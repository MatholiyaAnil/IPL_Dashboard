The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is locked and loaded for a blockbuster between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Gujarat Titans. This one&#39;s got spice, bite, and enough drama to keep you on the edge of your seat!</strong></p>

<p><strong>RCB are walking in with a spring in their step&mdash;two wins on the bounce away from home and the batting is looking red-hot. Virat Kohli and Phil Salt at the top? Absolute dynamite. And Rajat Patidar, wearing the captain&rsquo;s armband, has led with purpose and calm&mdash;runs, decisions, presence, he&#39;s ticking all the boxes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now here&rsquo;s the sub-plot. Mohammed Siraj&mdash;seven seasons in RCB colours&mdash;now lining up against them. He knows that ground like the back of his hand. And don&rsquo;t be surprised if there&rsquo;s a little chin music when he runs in to bowl to Kohli. That&rsquo;s a mouth-watering face-off. High-voltage stuff, that.</strong></p>

<p><strong>On the other side, Gujarat Titans have their own trump cards. Sai Sudharsan&rsquo;s in the form of his life. Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler are due, and when they fire, they don&rsquo;t just knock&mdash;they smash the door down. Middle-order? Still a work in progress, but they&rsquo;ll want to build on that big win over Mumbai.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And don&rsquo;t forget the venue. The Chinnaswamy isn&rsquo;t just a ground, it&rsquo;s a living, breathing beast. Short boundaries, flat deck&mdash;bowlers, beware. But the tale has a twist: the pitch looks dry and tired. Spinners could come into play. Tactical smarts will count tonight.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This one&rsquo;s not just two teams&mdash;it&rsquo;s two heavyweights throwing punches. RCB want to stamp their authority at home. GT want to prove they&rsquo;re not just good at home&mdash;they&rsquo;re good anywhere. Buckle up, this could go down to the wire!<br />

<p><strong>Pitch Report | Matthew Hayden &amp; Murali Kartik</strong><br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on pitch number 6 today, and interestingly, it wasn&rsquo;t used at all last season. The square boundaries measure 68 and 61 metres, while the cover and midwicket boundaries stretch to 74 and 68 metres respectively. The shortest boundary &mdash; third man/fine leg &mdash; is just 55 metres, with a straight hit at 73 metres. It&rsquo;s a dry surface, but local insights suggest it&rsquo;ll offer decent bounce. There&rsquo;s also a chance of dew later, which is why most teams have preferred chasing here.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s live and evenly spread across the center &mdash; the kind of surface seamers like Hazlewood and Ishant will be licking their lips over. Very firm underneath, and visually, you can spot the blend &mdash; a mix of grey and black clay. While it&rsquo;s dry, it should still play true with good bounce. And with those boundary sizes, especially straight down the ground, batters will fancy themselves if the ball comes on. Historically, the toss hasn&rsquo;t made much of a difference &mdash; only 3 of the last 7 games here were won chasing. Average first-innings score? Around 197. Expect something in that range again today.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Gujarat Titans emerged victorious in a thrilling encounter at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, chasing down 170 with ease, thanks to a masterclass from Jos Buttler and Sai Sudharsan. Despite a strong batting effort from Royal Challengers Bangalore, they could only manage 169/8 in their allotted 20 overs.</strong></p>

<p><strong>RCB got off to a shaky start, losing Virat Kohli early for just 7. They were further pegged back by Mohammed Siraj&rsquo;s impressive spell, picking up key wickets of Phil Salt (14) and Devdutt Padikkal (4). A valiant effort from Liam Livingstone, who scored 54 off 40 balls, helped steady the ship for RCB. Jitesh Sharma (33) and Tim David (32) also chipped in, but the middle-order collapse meant RCB could only set a modest target of 170.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In response, Gujarat Titans made light work of the chase, reaching the target in just 17.5 overs. Sudharsan played a crucial role with a composed 49 off 36 balls, while Buttler&rsquo;s explosive 73* from 39 balls guided them to victory. Rutherford&rsquo;s quick-fire 30* (18) further added to the momentum.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | RCB Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&nbsp;&quot;We were targeting around 190 after the powerplay, but the early wickets set us back.&nbsp;The intent was right, but ideally, we should&#39;ve only lost one or two wickets in the powerplay. Losing three made a big difference.Our bowlers were exceptional. They put in a lot of hard work, and despite the total not being easy to defend, they did brilliantly, pushing the opposition till the 18th over.After losing those three wickets, the way Jitesh, Tim, and the other batters came in and batted was fantastic. That was a big positive from this match.We&rsquo;re confident in our batting line-up. They&rsquo;re showing great intent, and that&rsquo;s a good sign moving forward for us.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong>Shubman Gill | GT Captain: </strong><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>&quot;Restricting them to 170 on this ground was a solid effort. This pitch can produce anything&mdash;sometimes it can get you to 250, other times it offers something for the bowlers early on. We knew that if we took early wickets, we&#39;d be in the game. It&#39;s disappointing, but you have to keep coming back and grabbing the next opportunity. With the bat, we adapted well to the situation, and that&#39;s what mattered. It&#39;s all about playing smartly according to the conditions.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong>Mohammed Siraj | Player of the Match:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>&quot;It was an emotional moment for me, switching from red to blue after spending seven years here. But once I got the ball in my hand, I was fine. As a huge Ronaldo fan, the celebration was for him. I&#39;ve been consistent with my performances, but during the break, I focused on correcting my mistakes and worked on my fitness. When I got picked up by Gujarat Titans, I had a conversation with Ashish Bhai, and Nehra Bhai always tells me to enjoy my bowling. Ishant Bhai helps with my line and length. My mindset is simple&mdash;believe in myself, and the pitch doesn&rsquo;t matter.&quot;</strong></span></p>

Both teams arrive with momentum yet carry distinctly different emotional baggage from their recent performances.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lucknow Super Giants enter the contest with a rollercoaster of emotions behind them. Their recent match against Delhi Capitals was a nail-biting affair that slipped through their fingers, only to be followed by a comprehensive victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad that restored their confidence. The bowling unit, initially struggling without key players Akash Deep and Mayank Yadav, found unexpected heroes in Shardul Thakur and Prince Yadav. Their resurgence couldn&#39;t have come at a better time, especially with the Ekana pitch promising a more bowler-friendly surface.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Punjab Kings, conversely, ride high on the wave of their recent triumph against the Gujarat Titans. Shreyas Iyer&#39;s nearly perfect 97 and the breakthrough performances of Priyansh Arya and Shashank Singh have injected new energy into the squad. Their batting depth looks formidable, though their bowling attack will be tested on a surface that demands precision and strategy.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The match presents a fascinating subtext of individual performances and team dynamics. Nicholas Pooran&#39;s explosive batting for LSG contrasts with Rishabh Pant&#39;s current struggles, while Punjab&#39;s Vyshak Vijaykumar has emerged as a crucial death-over specialist. Mitchell Marsh&#39;s consistent form adds another layer of intrigue to an already complex narrative.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As the sun sets on the Ekana Stadium, IPLfans can expect nothing less than a thrilling encounter that encapsulates the essence of T20 cricket &ndash; unpredictability, drama, and the potential for individual brilliance to transform a game.<br />

Stats At Ekana Stadium:</strong><br />
In 13 matches played at this venue, teams chasing have a slight advantage, winning 7 compared to 6 wins for teams batting first. The average score stands at 166. Pace bowlers have been more effective, taking 61% of the wickets, while spinners account for the remaining 39%.<br />

<p><strong>Pitch Report&nbsp; | Deep Dasgupta and Graeme Swann:</strong><br />
&quot;We&rsquo;re set for the first game of the season here in Lucknow, and the match will be played on a <strong>red soil pitch</strong>. Known for being a high-scoring venue, this surface offers good <strong>pace and bounce</strong>, with nice carry through to the keeper. The ground dimensions provide some relief for bowlers &mdash; it&rsquo;s <strong>70 meters</strong> to the right, <strong>64 meters</strong> to the left, and <strong>77 meters straight</strong> down the ground, which could help contain big hits.The pitch has an <strong>even covering of grass</strong>, but there&rsquo;s likely to be <strong>minimal seam or spin movement</strong>, making it an excellent surface for batting. It looks absolutely glorious for stroke play, and <strong>chasing might be the smarter option</strong> under these conditions.That said, there&rsquo;s a bit of breeze around and while dew is usually expected here, it wasn&rsquo;t present last night. So, while teams may lean toward chasing, <strong>batting first isn&rsquo;t a bad option either</strong> depending on strategy and conditions as the game progresses.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Punjab Kings have finally roared to life in IPL 2025! Chasing 172, they made light work of the target, breezing to 177/2 in just 16.2 overs, thanks to a blazing 69 off 34 from Prabhsimran Singh and a captain&rsquo;s knock from Shreyas Iyer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Electing to bowl first, PBKS got off to a dream start as Arshdeep Singh removed Mitchell Marsh for a golden duck. Despite a counter-attacking 44 from Nicholas Pooran, who hammered 7 boundaries, LSG kept losing wickets at key moments. Ayush Badoni played a gritty hand of 41, and Abdul Samad&rsquo;s late cameo (27 off 12) helped them post a competitive 171/7. But with Arshdeep (3/43) and Jansen (1/28) controlling the pace, LSG couldn&rsquo;t quite shift gears in the death overs.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The chase? Oh, it was a Prabhsimran masterclass! The wicketkeeper-batter unleashed his full range&mdash;lofts, scoops, and signature drives&mdash;bringing up his fifty in just 23 balls. A couple of towering sixes over mid-wicket lit up the Ekana night, before he fell on 69. But PBKS didn&rsquo;t break stride.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer, calm and calculated, anchored the chase with an unbeaten 52 off 30, while Impact Player Nehal Wadhera finished things in style with a rollicking 43*. The pair added an unbroken 67-run stand to seal the game with 22 balls to spare.</strong><br />

There are a lot of positives to take despite the loss&mdash;we just need to tighten a few areas and come back stronger in the next game.&rdquo;</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Shreyas Iyer | PBKS Captain:</strong><br />
<strong><span style=""color:#c0392b"">&ldquo;This is exactly the kind of start we needed. The boys executed their roles brilliantly&mdash;everyone contributed in their own way, and what we spoke about in the team meeting was implemented to perfection on the field.</span></strong><strong><span style=""color:#c0392b"">Honestly, there&rsquo;s no fixed formula or &lsquo;right combination&rsquo; in T20s. What matters most is the camaraderie and the synergy among players&mdash;when that clicks, the results follow. Every team in this tournament has the potential to win; it&rsquo;s about bringing that unified mindset into each game.</span></strong><strong><span style=""color:#c0392b"">As for me, I try to stay in the present and not get caught up in what&rsquo;s already done. Even this innings is history now&mdash;I&rsquo;m already looking ahead and focusing on the next challenge.&rdquo;</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Prabhsimran Singh | Player of the Match:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&ldquo;Everyone knows what a legend he is&mdash;having someone like Ricky Ponting as coach is a huge boost. He&rsquo;s always incredibly positive. He doesn&rsquo;t dwell on the &#39;what-ifs&#39; and keeps reminding us to back our natural game.</strong></span><span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>Those sweeps and switch hits? I&#39;ve put in a lot of practice on those in the nets. This is the kind of platform where performances can push you closer to your dream&mdash;playing for India.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>

Despite Hardik Pandya&rsquo;s return as captain, they fell short against Gujarat Titans. Mumbai&rsquo;s top order &mdash; Rohit Sharma, Ryan Rickelton, and Tilak Varma &mdash; have failed to fire, while the bowling lacks bite without Jasprit Bumrah. Selection confusion has also plagued MI, with in-form spinner Vignesh Puthur left out in the last game despite an impressive outing against CSK.KKR, meanwhile, bounced back strongly with a win over Rajasthan Royals. Quinton de Kock&rsquo;s unbeaten 97 and Moeen Ali&rsquo;s economical spell (2/23) stood out. The good news for KKR is Sunil Narine&rsquo;s return, setting up a potent spin duo with Varun Chakaravarthy to trouble MI&rsquo;s shaky batting.Wankhede&rsquo;s true bounce and short boundaries should favour big hitters like Andre Russell, while early swing might offer opportunities to pacers like Trent Boult and Spencer Johnson. Dew isn&rsquo;t expected to play a major role, but both teams could still prefer chasing.KKR ended a 12-year winless streak at Wankhede last season and have won five of their last six encounters against MI. With MI facing questions around form and strategy, KKR enter this clash with a slight edge.Will Mumbai finally click at their fortress, or will KKR add to their woes?&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Pitch Report:- </strong></p>

<p><strong>Eoin Morgan:</strong> &quot;We&rsquo;re in for a run-fest on what looks like a batting beauty. There&rsquo;s a healthy grass cover on top, and the surface underneath is firm and hard. Expect a high-scoring affair. Pace bowlers will need to be smart &mdash; the quicker you bowl, the further the ball is likely to travel. Since we&#39;re right in the center of the ground, batters have the full range of angles to exploit.&quot;&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Mumbai Indians registered a dominant 8-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede, making light work of a modest 117-run target with 43 balls to spare. The star of the show was Ryan Rickelton, who scored a fluent, unbeaten 62 off 41 balls, smashing five sixes and four boundaries to anchor the chase. Put into bat, KKR&#39;s innings never really took off. They lost Sunil Narine and Quinton de Kock in the first two overs, and the top order continued to tumble. Ashwani Kumar produced a dream spell, picking up 4 for 24, dismantling the middle order with sharp, intelligent pace bowling.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Only Angkrish Raghuvanshi (26 off 16) and Ramandeep Singh (22 off 12) showed brief resistance, but wickets fell regularly, and the Knight Riders were eventually bundled out for 116 in just 16.2 overs.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In reply, Rohit Sharma gave MI a brisk start before falling to Russell, but Rickelton and Suryakumar Yadav (27 off 9) ensured there were no hiccups. SKY was in sublime touch, hammering three fours and two sixes at a strike rate of 300 to wrap things up in style.&nbsp;<br />

Ajinkya Rahane | KKR Captain:<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">&quot;It was a collective batting failure for us. As I mentioned at the toss, it was a good wicket to bat on. A score of 180-190 would have been ideal, but we suffered a collective batting failure.At Wankhede, with extra pace and bounce, sometimes you need to use the wicket&#39;s characteristics. We need to recover fast from this game. The bowlers tried their best, but there just weren&#39;t enough runs on the board.We kept losing wickets &mdash; four in the powerplay &mdash; and failed to build momentum. We needed a partnership, one batsman to stay till the end, but that didn&#39;t happen for us tonight.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hardik Pandya | MI Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>&quot;A deeply satisfying victory, especially at home. The way everyone contributed was remarkable. Selecting standout performers is always challenging with our talented squad. Our scouts have been instrumental, scouting far and wide to discover exceptional talent like Ashwani. During our practice match, we noticed his extra swing as a left-arm bowler and potential for death-over bowling.His impact was immediate &ndash; taking Quinton&#39;s catch and then dismissing Russell, which was a crucial breakthrough. It&#39;s inspiring to see young players seizing their opportunities and building confidence. We have a fantastic blend of youth and experience, and this win represents a promising start to our tournament. Seeing young talents like Ashwani step up and &#39;come into the party&#39; is exactly what makes this team special.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ashwani Kumar | Player Of The Match:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>&quot;This is truly special for me. Winning Player of the Match in my first outing is beyond my expectations. I had confidence, but I&#39;d be lying if I said there weren&#39;t nerves before stepping onto the field.

Both former champions enter this contest with plenty to prove after contrasting starts to their campaigns.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rajasthan, still searching for their first victory after two matches, will look to harness home advantage despite their historically mixed results at this venue. Captain Riyan Parag returns to familiar territory in Assam, where his local knowledge could prove invaluable on a surface that showed considerable assistance to spinners in Wednesday&#39;s fixture. The Royals&#39; batting showed tremendous potential against Hyderabad, posting 242 in a spirited chase. Their challenge now lies in finding the right balance with their overseas selections, particularly in the bowling department, where they have several options to consider.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Chennai arrives with minimal recovery time following their Friday encounter against RCB at Chepauk. The Lions started brightly with a victory over Mumbai but will be eager to bounce back immediately. Their experienced squad knows how to navigate the ebbs and flows of a lengthy tournament. The tactical battle between these sides presents fascinating subplots. Will Ruturaj Gaikwad revert to his opening position? How will Chennai&#39;s spin-heavy attack fare on this helpful surface? Can the Royals&#39; batting lineup find consistency against CSK&#39;s varied bowling options ?Adding spice to the encounter are the players facing their former teams &ndash; Tushar Deshpande now represents Rajasthan after his stint with Chennai, while Shivam Dube faces his former Rajasthan teammates.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As floodlights illuminate the picturesque Barsapara Stadium, expect a compelling contest between two sides with championship pedigree looking to build momentum in what promises to be another fiercely competitive IPL season.&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Pitch Report:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Daren Ganga &amp; Shane Watson: </strong>&ldquo;Side boundaries are short &mdash; 63 metres and 66 metres &mdash; with 78 metres straight down the ground. The surface looks quite similar to the other night. There&rsquo;s a bit of sheen, but make no mistake, it&rsquo;s dry underneath. Expect the spinners to come into play through the middle overs &mdash; that&rsquo;ll be the key phase, especially with the quality on display from both sides. It&rsquo;s not one of those flat 200-run wickets, but still plenty in it for bat and ball. Conditions are set for a cracking contest tonight.&rdquo;</p>

&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rajasthan Royals clinched their first win of IPL 2025, edging past the Chennai Super Kings by 6 runs in a pulsating contest that swung till the final over.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Opting to bat first, RR were rocked early with the dismissal of Jaiswal in the opening over. However, Nitish Rana stole the show with a blazing 81 off just 36 balls, launching 10 fours and 5 sixes in a carnage that revived the innings. Sanju Samson provided early momentum, while Riyan Parag (37 off 28) anchored the middle overs. Despite losing wickets in a heap at the back end, RR managed a competitive 182/9, thanks to Rana&rsquo;s fireworks and Parag&rsquo;s handy knock.For CSK, Khaleel Ahmed (2/38), Pathirana (2/28), and Noor Ahmad (2/28) were clinical, regularly picking wickets to keep RR in check.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Chasing 183, CSK had a shaky start, losing Rachin Ravindra for a duck. Ruturaj Gaikwad stood tall, crafting a classy 63 off 44, ably supported by Dube and Jadeja. But the real twist came in the middle overs, where Wanindu Hasaranga spun a web, claiming 4 wickets for 35, including key scalps of Tripathi, Dube, Shankar, and Gaikwad &mdash; three of them after being hit for a six the previous ball!</strong></p>

<p><strong>CSK were still in the hunt with Dhoni and Jadeja at the crease, but a stunning catch from Hetmyer to dismiss Dhoni and a tight final over by Sandeep Sharma sealed the deal. Overton&#39;s late six threatened a heist, but it wasn&#39;t to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />

&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad | Chennai Super Kings Captain:<br />
<span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;In the powerplay, Nitish batted exceptionally well, but we weren&#39;t proactive enough. He was consistently finding runs behind square, and we should have adjusted our field quicker. In games like these, it&#39;s often about one big hit &mdash; and we were just one hit away from crossing the line.We gave away 8&ndash;10 runs through misfields, and that&#39;s an area we need to clean up. It&rsquo;s costing us games. That said, 180 was definitely a chaseable total on this wicket. It was a good surface to bat on, especially if you timed the ball well.At one stage, they looked set for 220&ndash;230, so I was happy with how we pulled it back. Historically, we&#39;ve had Ajinkya at No. 3 and Rayudu stabilizing the middle order. So we decided I&rsquo;d shift down a spot, and Rahul (Tripathi) &mdash; who&rsquo;s known for his aggressive starts &mdash; could express himself freely. Not much of a change really, since I&rsquo;m still walking in during the first or second over (smiles).There have been no discussions yet about changing that plan &mdash; it was something agreed upon during the auction. Personally, I&rsquo;m comfortable playing any role &mdash; rotating strike or taking risks when needed &mdash; especially with someone like Shivam at the other end.We haven&#39;t had the best starts so far, but once we get that rhythm at the top, our batting unit will click. There were a lot of positives today &mdash; Noor continues to bowl brilliantly, Khaleel&rsquo;s hitting his lengths, and Jaddu bhai was excellent. We just need that one breakthrough to build pressure. Once our fielding tightens up, we&rsquo;ll be a very dangerous side.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Riyan Parag | Rajasthan Royals Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#ff0066""><strong>&quot;(On the first win as captain) Took just two games, but honestly, it felt a lot longer than that! We still believe we were about 20 runs short today &mdash; we lost a couple of wickets in the middle which slowed us down. But credit to the bowlers, they did an outstanding job defending that total.After two tough outings, our chat was simple &mdash; forget the past, reset, and come out with a fresh mindset. Everyone responded really well.(On not completing Archer&#39;s spell) It was a situational call. Thankfully, we had seven bowling options and went with what felt right at the time. And that fielding effort &mdash; top-notch! We&rsquo;ve been working hard with Dishant Yagnik, our fielding coach, and the results are showing. It made up for the runs we felt we left on the table.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nitish Rana | Player of the Match:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#ff0066""><strong>&quot;I wanted to take full advantage of the new ball in the powerplay &mdash; that phase is key because once the ball gets older, it slows down and starts gripping. My aim was to play the field rather than focus too much on the bowler or pitch.Whenever fine leg or third man was up, I tried using the pace to place it in those gaps. In the previous two games, I was trying to hit the ball too hard. Today, I focused more on timing and placement &mdash; and it worked.&nbsp;It was a tactical decision from the coaches. I&rsquo;m happy to bat wherever the team needs me. At No. 4, I was over-hitting, and Riyan was doing something similar at three.

Both teams enter this clash with contrasting emotions but similar 1-1 records, setting the stage for an explosive encounter at Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Delhi&#39;s heroic one-wicket heist against LSG, where they chased down 210 from a seemingly impossible position of 65/5, has injected tremendous belief into Axar Patel&#39;s men. The star of that victory, Ashutosh Sharma, embodied their fearless approach with his match-winning 66 off just 31 balls, dedicated to team mentor Kevin Pietersen with an imaginary switch-hit celebration. Their bowling attack, spearheaded by Mitchell Starc and Kuldeep Yadav, will face its sternest test against SRH&#39;s destructive batting lineup. Starc, in particular, holds a psychological edge over Travis Head, having dismissed the Australian opener cheaply in last season&#39;s Qualifier 1.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Sunrisers arrive in Vizag, smarting from a rare batting misfire at home. After setting new benchmarks for aggressive batting with 286 against the Rajasthan Royals, they were brought back to earth by LSG, managing &quot;only&quot; 190 despite late fireworks from Aniket Verma and Pat Cummins.DC received a significant boost with KL Rahul&#39;s return after missing the opener due to the birth of his child. His experience will strengthen a top order that faltered badly against LSG, with no batsman in the top five crossing 30. With its shorter square boundaries, the picturesque Vizag stadium has been a batter&#39;s paradise, with recent first-innings scores of 191, 272, and 209. This venue perfectly suits both teams&#39; aggressive batting philosophies. As SRH&#39;s &quot;Travishek&quot; opening duo looks to rebound and DC&#39;s lower order hopes to build on their match-winning momentum, cricket fans can expect another high-scoring thriller in what has become one of the IPL&#39;s most entertaining matchups.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong><br />
<strong>Danny Morrison:</strong> &quot;A bright sunny day greets us here, and we&rsquo;re set for some high-octane action. The dimensions first - square boundaries are 66m and 60m, while straight down the ground is 73m. Short enough for the big hitters to fancy their chances. Now to the pitch &mdash; it&rsquo;s a hybrid with black soil on top and red soil underneath, which means early on, batters could dominate with true bounce and pace. But don&rsquo;t be surprised if spinners come into play later in the innings. Expect runs early, but keep an eye on the grip and turn as the surface wears in.&quot;&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Delhi Capitals Crush Sunrisers Hyderabad with Dominant All-Round Display in Visakhapatnam</strong></p>

<p>A blistering spell from <strong>Mitchell Starc</strong> (5/35) and a clinical top-order display saw the <strong>Delhi Capitals</strong> register a thumping <strong>7-wicket win</strong> over <strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad</strong>, chasing down 164 in just 16 overs.</p>

<p>Sunrisers, sent into bat, collapsed early after Starc&rsquo;s early burst reduced them to 25/3 inside 3 overs. <strong>Travis Head&nbsp;</strong>started brightly but fell just when he looked set. The only resistance came from young <strong>Aniket Verma</strong>, who played a sensational knock of <strong>74 off 41</strong> balls, peppering the stands with 6 sixes and 5 fours. He found some support from Klaasen (32 off 19), but Kuldeep Yadav&rsquo;s 3/22 in the middle overs broke the backbone. SRH were eventually bundled out for 163 in 18.4 overs.</p>

<p>In reply, <strong>Faf du Plessis (50 off 27)</strong> and <strong>Jake Fraser-McGurk (38 off 32)</strong> got Delhi off to a flying start. Despite a triple strike from debutant <strong>Zeeshan Ansari (3/42)</strong>, Delhi never lost control. <em><em>Abishek Porel (34</em> off 18)</em>* and <em><em>Stubbs (21</em> off 14)</em>* sealed the chase with 24 balls to spare.</p>

<p>It was a statement win for DC, while SRH now sit with back-to-back defeats and growing questions over their batting depth and bowling consistency.</p>

<span style=""color:#d35400""><strong>Pat Cummins, Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain: </strong></span>&ldquo;We just didn&rsquo;t get going today. Didn&rsquo;t put enough runs on the board. A few poor shot selections, and yes, those catches in the deep &mdash; they&rsquo;re part and parcel of T20 cricket, but they do hurt when you&#39;re trying to build momentum. Not a massive margin in the end. On another day, a couple of those shots come off, and the game swings differently. Just wasn&rsquo;t our day. We&rsquo;ll go back, reflect on a few decisions &mdash; both with the bat and ball &mdash; and look at our options. Pleased with Aniket Verma, though. Even before the tournament started, he impressed everyone in the lead-up. What we saw in practice, he brought into the game today. Gave us a genuine chance and showed maturity. It&#39;s still early. Two losses, yes, but nothing to panic about. We regroup, we rethink, and we move forward.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>Axar Patel, DC Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;&quot;I&rsquo;ve said it before &mdash; I&rsquo;m going to lead this side with the same mindset every game. In a tournament like this, you can&rsquo;t take any opposition lightly. All 10 teams are quality. Today we stuck to our plans, our processes, and executed really well, which made the difference. The original idea was to give Starc two overs upfront and hold two back for the death. But he was in great rhythm &mdash; I felt he could break the game open &mdash; so I gave him a third, and he got us a big wicket. That proved crucial. &quot;We&rsquo;ve got experienced players who constantly feed in suggestions &mdash; sometimes I take them, sometimes I back my gut. But I enjoy leading this group. Looking ahead to Kotla &mdash; it&rsquo;s a venue we know well. The key will be assessing the surface quickly and adapting. The plans will stay clear; it&rsquo;s all about execution.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>Mitchell Starc, Player of the Match:</strong></span>&nbsp;&quot;It&rsquo;s been a good day &ndash; with the ball, in the field, and with the bat as well. A complete team performance, and I&rsquo;m glad I could contribute to the win.&nbsp;Batters are smarter, matchups are well-known &ndash; so you&rsquo;ve got to think outside the box. Tried to mix it up a bit today, and it worked well. As a senior player, that&rsquo;s the challenge &ndash; keep evolving. You can&rsquo;t just go through the motions anymore. Great energy, great bunch to be around. Looking forward to building more momentum from here.&quot;</p>

Both teams are desperate to open their accounts after suffering defeats in their campaign openers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>All eyes will be on Hardik Pandya as he returns to lead Mumbai after serving his one-match suspension. His homecoming to Ahmedabad &ndash; where he once led GT to glory before his controversial exit &ndash; adds emotional weight to an already crucial encounter. Gujarat nearly pulled off a miracle against Punjab Kings, falling just 11 runs short of chasing down 243. Their batting firepower was evident as Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler, and Sherfane Rutherford made significant contributions. However, their death bowling was brutally exposed, with only R Sai Kishore emerging with respectable figures. Captain Shubman Gill might consider strengthening their pace attack with Ishant Sharma or Gerald Coetzee waiting in the wings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mumbai&#39;s batting collapsed in Chennai, managing only 155 against CSK. Rohit Sharma&#39;s four-ball duck set the tone, with Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav unable to capitalize on starts. The silver lining was Vignesh Puthur&#39;s impressive three-wicket haul on debut. The world&#39;s largest cricket stadium traditionally offers batting-friendly conditions, with dew likely to favor the chasing team. Six of eight IPL games played here last season were won by teams batting second. History favors the home side &ndash; Mumbai have never won an IPL match at this venue in three attempts against Gujarat. As Pandya returns to his former hunting ground, both teams know early-season momentum is at stake in what promises to be a fascinating battle under the Ahmedabad lights.<br />

<p><strong>Pitch Report |&nbsp;Nick Knight and&nbsp;Michael Clarke</strong></p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re back in Ahmedabad, and it&rsquo;s game two at this colossal venue. Over 400 runs the other night, but it&rsquo;s a new surface tonight! And it&rsquo;s not the same kind of strip, Nick. Different clay, a bit patchy &mdash; this one&#39;s got that two-paced feel. I reckon 180 could be par tonight. It&rsquo;ll do a bit with the new ball, and change of pace might be the go-to weapon.&nbsp;Hard to pick; both sides are well-balanced. But if there&rsquo;s any dew, you&rsquo;d want to chase. One thing&rsquo;s for sure &mdash; top cricket needed tonight to grab the points.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Gujarat Titans maintained their dominance at home with a convincing 36-run win over Mumbai Indians, making it 4-0 against MI in Ahmedabad. Shubman Gill&rsquo;s side put up a formidable total of 196/8, built around Sai Sudharsan&rsquo;s classy 63 off 41 balls and handy contributions from Gill (38 off 27) and Buttler (39 off 24). The duo laid the foundation with a 78-run opening stand, MI pulled things back slightly with wickets in a cluster.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hardik Pandya, leading MI against his former franchise, picked up 2/29, while Boult, Chahar, and debutant Raju chipped in with a wicket each. But MI&#39;s bowling leaked 14 wides&mdash;a costly lapse on a two-paced surface.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In reply, MI were rocked early by Mohammed Siraj, who cleaned up Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton inside 5 overs. While Tilak Varma (39) and Suryakumar Yadav (48 off 28) revived hopes with a brisk 62-run stand, Prasidh Krishna&#39;s double strike&mdash;dismissing both set batters&mdash;derailed the chase.</strong></p>

<p><strong>GT&rsquo;s spinners choked the middle overs, and Siraj (2/34) along with Prasidh (2/18) delivered clinical spells.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />

<strong><span style=""color:#000000"">Hardik Pandya | Mumbai Indians Captain:</span><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9"">&quot;Tough to put. Batting and bowling, we were 15-20 short. There were errors. We were not professionals in the field. That cost us 20-25 runs, which is a lot in T20 cricket. Gill and Sudharsan batted brilliantly. We bowled well, and there were some balls here and there but otherwise, the way they batted was exceptional. They didn&rsquo;t take chances. They hit boundaries. Without taking high risks, they hit boundaries, and we were left with catching up. There shouldn&rsquo;t be a concern. But I think we have to take responsibility. Batters will have to join the party, and hopefully, they&#39;ll join in soon.I was just thinking that I bowled too many slower balls. They saw that the ball was gripping, and those were the toughest balls to face and some were shooting low. It makes life difficult for the batters, and they used them well.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#000000"">Shubman Gill | Gujarat Titans Captain:</span><br />
<span style=""color:#000066"">&quot;I think yeah, the decision was taken before we played the first match that we will be playing the second match on a black soil wicket. Yeah, that was also another factor. I feel this wicket also suits our batting and as you can see, it worked out well for us.</span></strong><span style=""color:#000066""><strong>That&#39;s one of the factors batting on a black soil wicket. Once the ball gets old, it&#39;s difficult to clear the boundary. We discussed it in the team meeting that we will maximize the powerplay.</strong><strong>I think we can all talk about the plan but at the end if you get the desired result, all the things seem to be in place.</strong><strong>I don&#39;t know maybe, this could be the first time that he has bowled only 2 overs for us in a match. I actually kept his overs to bowl at the end but with the way the fast bowlers were bowling, I just didn&#39;t want to bring him back in. Prasidh bowled beautifully so I thought why not continue with him.</strong><strong>Yeah, we have seen the par score on those wickets so we are looking forward to our next two away games.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<strong><span style=""color:#000066"">&quot;Nothing much to be honest. I don&#39;t have many words to say. I was itching to bowl. It was till the 10th over.

We knew that into the wicket was the way to go.I just figured that was working, so I did not want to test the speed gun.

Both teams enter this contest with winning momentum after successful opening games.The last time these teams met produced high drama with RCB&#39;s Yash Dayal defending 10 runs in the final over against MS Dhoni to secure a playoff berth. The wild celebrations at Chinnaswamy Stadium that night have only intensified this rivalry.Chennai holds historical dominance with a commanding 22-11 overall record against RCB, including an overwhelming 8-1 advantage at Chepauk. RCB&#39;s lone victory in Chennai came way back in 2008, the inaugural IPL season.CSK opened their campaign with a tense victory over Mumbai Indians, thanks to their spin trio of Noor Ahmad (4/18), Ravindra Jadeja, and R Ashwin who strangled MI&#39;s batting. Rachin Ravindra&#39;s steady batting sealed the chase in the final over.RCB, meanwhile, conquered defending champions KKR at Eden Gardens. Phil Salt (56) and Virat Kohli (59*) set the platform with a blazing 95-run opening stand, before captain Rajat Patidar&#39;s quickfire 34 finished the job with 22 balls to spare. Josh Hazlewood and Krunal Pandya starred with the ball.The Chepauk pitch presents a significant tactical battle. RCB&#39;s batting lineup, built primarily for pace-friendly conditions, may struggle against CSK&#39;s world-class spin attack. Only captain Patidar among RCB&#39;s top eight batters has a better strike rate against spin than pace.Conversely, RCB&#39;s spin attack &ndash; featuring Krunal Pandya, an inexperienced Suyash Sharma, and part-time options &ndash; could be vulnerable against CSK&#39;s four left-handed batters. However, early-season Chennai pitches might not yet have developed their traditional spin-friendly characteristics.Bhuvneshwar Kumar might return for RCB after missing the opener with a minor injury, while CSK&#39;s Matheesha Pathirana remains doubtful for the second consecutive game.This clash transcends cricket as it represents neighboring states with passionate fan bases, both worshipping cricket icons who aren&#39;t native to their regions. Though CSK start as favorites at home, RCB&#39;s new-found confidence makes this battle too close to call.<br />

<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Teams batting first have had an advantage here in the past, winning 50 of the 87 games played here in the IPL, with the highest score being 246 and the average 1st innings score being 164. Pacers have picked up 61% of the wickets in the venue during the IPL, but&nbsp;in the opening game this year 25 out of the 40 overs of which 14 of the 20 in the second innings, were bowled by the spinners! Adding to it&nbsp;Chepauk has had the best economy in the middle overs at a venue in the IPL since 2023. Will it be spin to win tonight?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Danny Morrison and Matthew Hayden:</strong> &quot;We are in the pitch next to the one used the other night on Sunday. So the dimensions are 70m and 63m on the sides, and 74m straight. There was quite a lot of dew last night. It&#39;s not going to be a 200+ type of wicket. Tonight&#39;s going to be a battle of attrition.&quot;<br />

<p><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad, CSK Skipper: &quot;To be honest, I felt 170 was a par score on this wicket.

You try to be a step ahead, but sometimes it just doesn&rsquo;t come off.

Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma provided the explosive start that has become their trademark, as all six top-order batters struck at 200+ strike rates.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lucknow, meanwhile, suffered a heartbreaking defeat against Delhi Capitals, failing to defend 209 despite being in commanding positions multiple times. The Rishabh Pant era began with promise but ended in disappointment, as their revamped bowling attack couldn&#39;t close out the game.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Despite their batting dominance, SRH&#39;s bowling showed vulnerability against Rajasthan.LSG&#39;s bowling worries are more acute with a makeshift attack that features just two specialist pacers. While Ravi Bishnoi and Shardul Thakur bring international experience, they struggled in the opener. The visitors have Avesh Khan joining the squad, but may also consider introducing Caribbean speedster Shamar Joseph.</strong></p>

<p><strong>LSG&#39;s top order, featuring Mitchell Marsh and Nicholas Pooran, who made impactful contributions against DC, possesses the firepower to match SRH at this venue. However, they&#39;ll need more from Aiden Markram, Pant, and Ayush Badoni, who failed to leave a mark in their opener. The Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium&#39;s surface remains a batter&#39;s paradise. The previous game here saw a staggering match aggregate of 528 runs, and today&#39;s encounter promises more of the same under lights.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Despite SRH&#39;s dominance in their last encounter, LSG holds a 3-1 advantage in their overall IPL head-to-head record. At this venue, the teams have split their two previous meetings. As the Orange Army aims for back-to-back victories to solidify their early-season momentum, the Super Giants will be desperate to get their first points on the board and prove that their new era under Pant has genuine promise.<br />

<p><strong>Pitch Report | Deep Dasgupta:</strong><br />
&quot;Welcome to Hyderabad, where runs have flowed like water in 2024. This season, we&rsquo;ve seen an average of 24 sixes per game, and the last match here dished out 30 sixes and a mind-boggling 528 runs. You might think it&#39;s down to short boundaries&mdash;but hold on! It&#39;s 69 meters to the right, 67 to the left, and 79 straight down&mdash;so it&rsquo;s not the size of the ground. The magic is in the pitch.Tonight, we&rsquo;re on a fresh surface&mdash;unlike the last game&rsquo;s strip, which had a hint of grass. This one? Barren. Bare. Not a blade of grass. It&rsquo;s firm, and you can hear it when you tap it. But look closely&mdash;there are minor abrasions and tiny cracks around the good length areas. Not alarming, but something to keep an eye on. The ball might grip a touch or slow down as it gets older.It&#39;s a red-soil wicket, so expect bounce and carry, especially early. But bowlers beware&mdash;there&rsquo;s no dew expected, just like the last game. That means bat first, go hard, and aim for that 200-plus mark. We might not hit 300 tonight&mdash;but trust me, there are plenty of fireworks in store!&quot;</p>

Lucknow Super Giants demolished Sunrisers Hyderabad by 5 wickets at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, exacting sweet revenge for last season&#39;s humiliation at the same venue. After Pant opted to bowl, Shardul Thakur struck early blows with consecutive wickets. Travis Head threatened briefly with 47, but regular wickets kept the hosts in check. Despite Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen, and Aniket Verma chipping in, SRH could only post 190/9 &ndash; Thakur finishing with impressive figures of 4/34.<br />
The chase began with an early setback as Markram fell to Shami, but what followed was carnage. Nicholas Pooran unleashed fury with 70 off just 26 balls. Mitchell Marsh matched him with 52 off 31, their 113-run partnership crushing SRH&#39;s hopes.Though LSG lost a few quick wickets afterward, Abdul Samad (22* off 8) applied the finishing touches against his former team. The victory marks LSG&#39;s first points under new captain Rishabh Pant and delivers a reality check to Hyderabad&#39;s explosive batting lineup.With this impressive performance, Lucknow not only win but significantly boost their net run rate early in the tournament.&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#d35400""><strong>&quot;Yeah, it was a different wicket tonight. The key is always to show up with a positive mindset, and credit to them &mdash; they played well.It was still a good pitch. The one the other night was probably the best wicket in the world &mdash; tonight&rsquo;s was the second-best! But yeah, the cutters were gripping a little more today. Every game&rsquo;s a fresh start. I thought we bowled alright &mdash; they just had better plans and executed them well. Losing Ishan and Klaasen early hurt our momentum, but getting up to 190 was still a decent effort.Ideally, you want someone batting through the innings like Ishan did last game. But credit to their bowlers, they kept the pressure on.We&rsquo;ve got a deep batting line-up. The message to the guys is &mdash; if you&#39;re in, go for it. We&rsquo;re not asking anyone to bat 60 balls, but to back themselves and go hard.We&rsquo;ll review this game, look at the one or two moments where we could&rsquo;ve done better &mdash; that&rsquo;s usually the difference in T20s. But like I said last time, we won&rsquo;t get too high or too low. It&rsquo;s a long season &mdash; 14 games &mdash; and we&rsquo;ll move on quickly.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rishabh Pant | Lucknow Super Giants Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>&quot;Big relief for us. We looked at the positives from the last match and executed much better tonight.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a concern, but we&rsquo;re trying to focus only on what we can control. That&rsquo;s something my mentor always reminds me.The idea was to give him freedom. We know what he&rsquo;s capable of &mdash; if he gets going, it changes games quickly. The environment&rsquo;s been good. Everyone&rsquo;s training hard. We haven&rsquo;t played our best cricket yet, but we&rsquo;re taking it one match at a time and learning with each game.&quot;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shardul Thakur| Player of the Match&nbsp;:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>&quot;Honestly,&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a late IPL call. I was preparing to play county cricket if things didn&rsquo;t work out. During the Ranji Trophy, I got a call from Zaheer Khan saying I might be picked as a replacement and if I came in, I&rsquo;d start. That moment brought the IPL mindset back. The auction didn&rsquo;t go my way, but I never gave up. Skills are there &ndash; it&rsquo;s about staying in the moment.With the new ball, the plan was simple &ndash; go full and look for swing. We know Abhishek and Head love to go hard, so I thought why not take my chances too? You can pick wickets early if the ball swings.

<p><strong>Pitch Report | Daren Ganga and Shane Watson:</strong><br />
<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Royals taking on the Knight Riders here in Guwahati &mdash; a venue that doesn&rsquo;t have a rich IPL history just yet. Let&rsquo;s jump straight into the dimensions: it&rsquo;s 76 meters down the ground, with square boundaries measuring 64 meters on either side &mdash; so fairly balanced, no real bias for the captains to consider. The Royals went with just one specialist spinner in their last game here.&nbsp;Just looking at the surface, it&rsquo;s quite dry, and there isn&rsquo;t much grass cover, especially away from the central strip near the crease. That&rsquo;s a clear sign. Since 2021, the average first-innings score here in T20s is 163, which tells us the pitch tends to slow down slightly. And, importantly, teams batting first have won six out of seven matches at this venue. So, expect the surface to dry out further &mdash; and expect spin to have a real impact tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Quinton de Kock put on a one-man show in Guwahati, powering Kolkata Knight Riders to an emphatic 8-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals. Chasing a modest 152, de Kock remained unbeaten on 97 off just 61 balls, smashing 8 fours and 6 sixes in a masterclass of clean hitting. Despite Moeen Ali falling cheaply for 5 and Rahane departing for 18, KKR never looked under pressure. Young Angkrish Raghuvanshi gave solid support with an unbeaten 22, but it was all about QDK, who launched Theekshana, Archer, and Hasaranga into the stands with ease. He was unbeaten on 97* &mdash; no century, but no regrets either. opened the innings, carried his bat, and handed Kolkata Knight Riders their first win of the season. A proper statement from the left-hander! Earlier in the evening, Rajasthan Royals stumbled to 151/9 &mdash; the lowest first-innings total this IPL. After a brisk start in the powerplay, they lost momentum quickly. From 67/1, they collapsed to 82/5, with Moeen Ali (2/23) and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/17) choking the middle overs. Riyan Parag&rsquo;s 25 and Jurel&rsquo;s 33 were the only bright spots. Spencer Johnson was expensive, but Arora and Harshit picked two wickets apiece. Jofra Archer leaked 33 in just 2.3 overs, and Hasaranga struggled with the ball. The Royals were sloppy, with fielding errors compounding their problems.KKR finished it off in just 17.3 overs. Statement made. Points on the board.&nbsp;</strong><br />

<p><strong>Riyan Parag | Rajasthan Royals Captain:<br />
<span style=""color:#ff0099"">&quot;I think 170 would&rsquo;ve been a reasonable total, but we ended up about 20 runs short. The plan initially was to get Quinny early, but once that didn&rsquo;t happen, we shifted our focus to trying to contain them through the middle overs.Last season, the team wanted me to bat at No. 4 and I embraced that role. This time, it&#39;s No. 3, and as a professional, I&rsquo;m happy to adapt to what the team needs.We&rsquo;ll take the learnings from this game, make sure we don&rsquo;t repeat the same mistakes, and aim to come out with a fresh mindset when we face CSK.&quot;</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ajinkya Rahane | Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>&quot;The first six overs were really important and I think we bowled brilliantly during that phase&mdash;conceding just about 40-44 runs and picking up crucial wickets. The middle overs were key too, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we had spoken about before the game. Moeen Ali, coming in for his first match, stepped up big time alongside Varun. Unfortunately, Sunil Narine wasn&#39;t well, but Moeen grabbed his chance and made it count.In this format, you want your players to go out and play fearless cricket. Our batting unit is full of explosive players&mdash;guys who&rsquo;ve done it for the team before. We just focus on giving them the freedom to express themselves. Credit also goes to our bowlers. Moeen&rsquo;s mindset was clear&mdash;he wanted wickets, and that&#39;s exactly what he went after.As for Moeen&rsquo;s role, we gave him complete freedom. He&rsquo;s a quality player, and with his experience of opening in the past, it was a great chance for him to go out there and play his natural game. Very pleased with his contribution.For us, it&rsquo;s about staying in the moment. Whether we win or lose, the focus is always on learning and bouncing back stronger in the next game.&quot;</strong></span><br />

<span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>&quot;Felt good to get the opportunity and glad I could make it count. After retiring from international cricket, to be honest, I haven&rsquo;t faced too many challenges yet. Had a nice three-month break and only about a 10-day prep before the season started, so I came in fresh.</strong></span><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>It&rsquo;s just my second game here, so I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep things simple&mdash;read the pitch, watch how the ball&rsquo;s behaving, and play the situation.

It was about playing smart and getting the job done.</strong></span><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>As for joining KKR, it&rsquo;s been a great experience. I really enjoy new environments and meeting new people. Sometimes it takes time for a team to welcome you in, but here at KKR, they&rsquo;ve embraced me from the get-go&mdash;it feels good.</strong></span><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>There wasn&rsquo;t really a talk about NRR. With the way the pitch played&mdash;turning and stopping&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t the right surface to force that kind of game. It was more of a grafting wicket. Maybe if we get a better surface, that&rsquo;s a conversation for another day. Tonight, it was just about finishing the chase.&quot;</strong></span></p>

Gujarat aren&#39;t just a team; they&#39;re a winning machine.<strong> With Shubman Gill at the helm, they&#39;ve got a squad that screams championship DNA. The big-ticket acquisition of Jos Buttler adds serious firepower to an already lethal lineup. </strong>Throw in Rashid Khan&#39;s magic and new bowling weapons like Kagiso Rabada and Mohammed Siraj, and you&#39;ve got a nightmare matchup for any opposition. Punjab Kings are the perennial underdogs with a star-studded reset. <strong>Shreyas Iyer&#39;s leadership and Ricky Ponting&#39;s</strong> <strong>coaching </strong>create a potent mix of aggression and strategy. With Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis in the middle order, they&#39;ve got match-winners who can turn games on their head. Yuzvendra Chahal&#39;s spin and Lockie Ferguson&#39;s pace add serious international class. <strong>Narendra Modi Stadium is no ordinary ground. Last season saw dramatic shifts &ndash; teams bundled out for under 100 or sailing past 199. </strong>The&nbsp;Gujarat Titans look more settled, but in the IPL, never write off an underdog. <strong>Punjab Kings aren&#39;t just playing to compete but to prove a point. Buckle up for a cracker of a match.<br />

<p><strong>Pitch Report | Matthew Hayden &amp; Eoin Morgan</strong><br />
&quot;We&rsquo;re standing on pitch number six today, and it&rsquo;s an absolute beauty. This is a relatively compact ground &mdash; just 64 meters to my left, 66 meters to my right, and 72 meters straight down the ground.&nbsp;Morgs, what&rsquo;s your take on tonight&rsquo;s surface? This pitch looks pristine &mdash; a lovely even covering of grass which is always a sign of consistent bounce. From my experience, when it looks this good at this venue, there&rsquo;s little for batters to fear. If the ball comes on nicely, expect plenty of boundaries cleared tonight.The stats back that up too. The average first-innings score here is 185, and we&rsquo;ve seen teams cross 200 in 10 of the last 17 games. Dew is expected later tonight, so if you win the toss.You absolutely chase. That&rsquo;s the advantage here. But even if you&rsquo;re sent in to bat first, don&rsquo;t panic &mdash; this surface is a batter&rsquo;s paradise. Get ahead early and keep pushing. Either way, it&rsquo;s a high-scoring contest in the making.&quot;<br />

<p><strong>In a match where boundaries rained and bowlers prayed, Punjab Kings pulled off a high-octane 11-run win over Gujarat Titans in a clash that had everything &mdash; blistering strokes, brain-fade dismissals, and a final-over twist.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer led from the front, nearly scripting a T20 masterclass with an unbeaten 97 off 42 balls, smashing 9 sixes and turning Narendra Modi Stadium</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>into a launchpad. He was brilliantly supported by Priyansh Arya&rsquo;s fearless 47 and Shashank Singh&rsquo;s 16-ball 44, as Punjab piled up a towering 243/5.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Titans, though, came swinging. Sai Sudharsan lit it up with a classy 74, while Jos Buttler&rsquo;s 54 off 33 kept the game on a knife&rsquo;s edge. Then came Sherfane Rutherford, smashing his way to 46, nearly stealing it. But Arshdeep Singh held his nerve, picking two vital scalps and deflecting a heartbreaking run-out of Tewatia to turn the tide.</strong></p>

<p><strong>With 27 needed off the last over, GT&rsquo;s fire fizzled as Arshdeep cleaned up Rutherford, sealing the win.<br />

<p><strong>Shubman Gill | Gujarat Titans Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>&quot;Yeah, I think we had our moments &mdash; both while bowling and batting &mdash; but we let ourselves down in the field. Dropping those chances definitely hurt us, and chasing a target like that was always going to be tough.There was a crucial phase in the middle where we only managed around 18 runs in three overs. Even at the start, we didn&rsquo;t get going &mdash; scored just about 30-40 in the first three overs. That patch probably cost us in the end. Still, I&rsquo;d say there were a lot of positives for us to take, and it&rsquo;s a good starting point for the season&nbsp;It&rsquo;s never easy coming in cold as an impact player after sitting for 15-16 overs and executing yorkers under pressure. Full credit to him and the others for the way they bowled at the death.This is always a high-scoring ground. You might post 230 or even 240 here, but the real challenge is in defending it. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll need to address moving forward.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer | Punjab Kings Captain &amp; Player of the Match:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&quot;Ecstatic, to be honest. Getting 97* in the first match &mdash; that&rsquo;s just the icing on the cake. There&rsquo;s no better feeling. For me, it was all about adapting quickly. That first boundary off the first ball gave me a massive confidence boost. And that flicked six off Rabada &mdash; I feel like that&rsquo;s when the momentum shifted in our favor.There was a bit of extra bounce early on, but we adapted really well. Shashank&rsquo;s knock &mdash; 44 off just 16 or 17 balls &mdash; was incredible. With the dew setting in, we knew the conditions would tilt slightly, so it was all about execution, and I&rsquo;m glad we did that.Vyshak is such a character &mdash; funny, but with a brilliant attitude. He brings great energy, and it was fantastic to see him bowl with such intent. Arshdeep played a key role too. He mentioned the ball was reversing slightly, and even saliva was helping with that.We&rsquo;ve done a lot of groundwork before the season &mdash; left no stone unturned.

<p>IPL&#39;s <strong>most expensive player at 27 crore</strong>, Pant returns to the venue where he received a hero&#39;s welcome last season, but this time as opposition captain. Across the field, <strong>KL Rahul</strong> potentially makes his DC debut after his LSG exit, completing this remarkable player swap storyline.</p>

<p>With <strong>Axar Patel</strong> taking Delhi&#39;s captaincy reins, both teams enter a new era following extensive squad revamps. DC&#39;s previously leaky bowling attack now features <strong>Mitchell Starc</strong>, <strong>T Natarajan</strong> and <strong>Mohit Sharma</strong> alongside <strong>Kuldeep Yadav</strong>.</p>

<p>LSG counters with batting firepower led by <strong>Nicholas Pooran</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Mitchell Marsh</strong> despite their depleted Indian pace resources with <strong>Mohsin Khan ruled out</strong>. Their impressive<strong>&nbsp;win rate batting first</strong> since 2022 could influence their approach.</p>

<p>The <strong>head-to-head stands at 3-2</strong> favoring LSG, but DC&#39;s reinforced bowling unit faces Lucknow&#39;s six-hitting specialists in what shapes up as a classic attack versus firepower contest.<br />

<p><strong>Pitch Report | Pommie Mbangwa and WV Raman:</strong><br />
&quot;It&#39;s a nice surface today, especially considering the atmospheric conditions. There was a slight rain threat, but we hope it stays away. Look at the dimensions: square boundaries at 62m each, a straight hit reaching 73m, and just 56m behind me. WV Raman, what do you make of this surface?<br />
The pitch is rolled to perfection&mdash;hard, even, and with very little grass, thanks to a month-long nonstop preparation by the curator. Normally, tracks here yield plenty of runs, and tonight will be no different.&quot;</p>

<p>In a high-scoring, edge-of-the-seat thriller at Vizag, <strong>Delhi Capitals</strong> stunned <strong>Lucknow Super Giants</strong> by <strong>1 wicket</strong> with <strong>3 balls to spare</strong>, chasing down a daunting target of <strong>210</strong> in a game that ebbed and flowed right until the final over.</p>

<p>Earlier, LSG rode on blistering half-centuries from <strong>Mitchell Marsh (72 off 36)</strong> and <strong>Nicholas Pooran (75 off 30)</strong> to post <strong>209/8</strong>. The duo launched a brutal assault in the middle overs, hammering 13 sixes between them and propelling LSG past 200. However, DC clawed back late with <strong>Mitchell Starc (3/42)</strong> and <strong>Kuldeep Yadav (2/20)</strong> keeping things in check. The collapse in the final five overs &mdash; where LSG lost 6 wickets for 46 runs &mdash; ultimately proved costly.</p>

<p>In response, Delhi got off to a nightmare start, losing their top three inside the first two overs. But from 7/3, the Capitals showed remarkable character. <strong>Ashutosh Sharma</strong>, promoted as an Impact Player, played the innings of a lifetime, smashing an unbeaten <strong>66 off 31 balls</strong>, including 5 sixes and 5 fours.</p>

<p>He found support from <strong>Vipraj Nigam (39 off 15)</strong> as the pair stitched a crucial 55-run stand that brought DC back into the contest. The game came down to the final over, with 6 needed. Ashutosh, calm under pressure, smoked a six to seal a remarkable win.<br />

<p><strong>Rishabh Pant | Lucknow Super Giants Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>&quot;I think we had enough runs on the board. The batters did really well, but we lost some momentum between overs 13 to 17. Still, it was a competitive total on this surface.As a team, we&#39;re looking to take positives from every game. The more we stick to the basics, the better it will be for us going forward.It&rsquo;s quite clear where it slipped away. This was a good wicket to bat on, and they had two key partnerships &mdash; Stubbsy, Ashutosh, and another guy &mdash; that really took the game away from us.As the ball got older, there was more on offer for the bowlers. We felt the pressure in the final phase. It&#39;s still early in the tournament, and while pressure is part of the game, so is learning from moments like this.Of course, luck plays its part. If that ball had missed the pad, it was a stumping chance. But you can&rsquo;t dwell on these things. The focus has to be on playing good, consistent cricket from here on.&quot;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Axar Patel | Delhi Capitals Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&quot;Under my captaincy, you might see a few more thrillers like this!&nbsp;We got the win, so let&rsquo;s not overthink things like why Stubbs bowled or anything like that. After losing four wickets inside the powerplay, it was an outstanding effort from the boys to pull it back and chase this down.Since last year, with the impact player rule, we&rsquo;ve seen this shift. Bowlers are getting hit, but they&rsquo;re also picking up wickets. You have to be mentally ready for that &mdash; if you&#39;re being attacked, there&rsquo;s always a chance to strike back.To be honest, we gave away a few extra runs in the powerplay and dropped some catches too. At one point, it looked like they were heading for 240-250. But the way we bowled in the last seven overs &mdash; giving just 40-odd &mdash; that was a brilliant comeback.We&rsquo;ve been in camp for over a week now, and everyone understands each other&rsquo;s strengths. We saw potential in Vipraj Nigam &mdash; and tonight, he showed why we backed him. I&rsquo;m confident he&rsquo;ll keep growing and deliver in the games to come.&quot;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ashutosh Sharma | Player of the Match:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&quot;Honestly, this is something I&rsquo;ve been working on since last season. There were a couple of games where I took it deep but couldn&rsquo;t finish &mdash; got out at the wrong time. That stayed with me, and over the past year, I&rsquo;ve made it a focus &mdash; especially in domestic cricket, trying to finish games consistently.I have a lot of belief in myself. I knew that if I could take it into the last over, anything was possible. In T20 cricket, once the equation narrows down, pressure shifts. I just backed the shots I&rsquo;ve been practicing in the nets &mdash; nothing fancy, just execution and self-belief.First of all, hats off to Vipraj &mdash; what a knock! I just kept telling him: if you&#39;re confident you can find the boundary, back yourself and go for it. We kept talking throughout, kept each other calm, and that made a big difference.More than anything, I just wanted to put into play all the hard work I&#39;ve done in training. I&rsquo;m really happy to contribute and would love to dedicate this award to my mentor, Shikhar Paaji (Dhawan), who&rsquo;s not here today but has played a big role in my journey.&quot;</strong></span></p>

It&rsquo;s the <strong>El Clasico of the IPL</strong> as <strong>Chennai Super Kings (CSK) take on Mumbai Indians (MI) in Match No. 3 at Chepauk!</strong></p>

<p><strong>MI will be led by Suryakumar Yadav,</strong> stepping in for Hardik Pandya, who serves a one-match ban for a slow over-rate from last season&rsquo;s final league game. With <strong>Rohit Sharma, Tilak Varma, and SKY</strong> forming a formidable batting trio, MI will aim for a strong start. However, the absence of <strong>Jasprit Bumrah for the initial few games</strong> could be a concern for them. Interestingly, <strong>CSK&rsquo;s former all-rounder Mitchell Santner</strong> will be donning MI colors this year, adding an intriguing subplot to the contest.</p>

<p><strong>CSK, on the other hand, have revamped their squad while retaining their core.</strong> The legendary <strong>MS Dhoni, along with Ravindra Jadeja, Matheesha Pathirana, and Shivam Dube,</strong> hold the key to their success. Under the yellow floodlights of Chepauk, the Super Kings will be eager to start their campaign with a bang, backed by the ever-passionate <strong>Whistle Podu Army!</strong></p>

<p>With <strong>power-hitters, world-class bowlers, and a history of nail-biters,</strong> this clash is set to be a <strong>high-voltage showdown!</strong> Will CSK dominate at home, or will MI silence the Chennai crowd? <strong>Fasten your seatbelts&mdash;the IPL rivalry is back!<br />

&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav (MI Captain):</strong><br />
<strong><span style=""color:#2980b9"">&quot;Absolutely. We were probably 15&ndash;20 runs short, but the fight the boys showed out there was commendable. That&rsquo;s what MI is known for &mdash; giving opportunities to youngsters and backing them. The scouts work hard for 10 months a year, and Vignesh is a brilliant product of that process.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#2980b9"">&quot;I had one over from him up my sleeve in case the game went deep, and when it did, it was a no-brainer to hand him the 18th. He showed great temperament.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#2980b9"">&quot;There wasn&rsquo;t much dew, but the pitch was a bit sticky. Credit to Ruturaj &mdash; the way he batted in the second innings took the game away from us.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#2980b9"">&quot;It&rsquo;s still early days in the tournament. There&rsquo;s a long way to go.&quot;</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad (CSK Captain):</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;Happy to be on the winning side. Of course, we would&rsquo;ve liked to be a bit more clinical, but that&rsquo;s how the game goes sometimes.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;The role I&rsquo;m playing is based on the team&rsquo;s requirements, and if it brings better balance, I&rsquo;m more than happy to adapt and change my position. It&rsquo;s all about what&rsquo;s best for the team.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;The spinners were spot on tonight. Right after the auction, one of the things we were most excited about was seeing all three of them &mdash; bowling in tandem at Chepauk. That&rsquo;s a big strength for us.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;Khaleel brings a lot of experience, and Noor is a true X-factor &mdash; that&rsquo;s exactly why we wanted him in the squad. And it&rsquo;s always great to have someone like Ash in the mix as well.&quot;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Noor Ahmad (Player of the Match):</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;It feels really special to play here in the IPL. I&#39;m happy for the team and pleased with my contribution today.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;The main focus was to keep it simple &mdash; just land the ball in the right areas. The wicket of Surya was a big one, and that stumping by MSD... it was out of this world!&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p>Both teams have kept their <strong>core intact</strong> while making some bold new additions, setting the stage for an epic battle. <strong>SRH, led by Pat Cummins,</strong> enter the contest as early favorites, boasting a <strong>well-balanced squad</strong> featuring match-winners like <strong>Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen, Abhishek Sharma, and Nitish Reddy</strong>, along with a lethal bowling unit of <strong>Mohammed Shami and Adam Zampa.</strong>&nbsp;The Orange Army looks primed to go all the way this season!</p>

<p>However, <strong>RR won&rsquo;t back down without a fight!</strong> With <strong>Sanju Samson nursing a finger injury, young sensation Riyan Parag</strong> has been handed the captaincy. The Royals have made <strong>bold moves</strong> in their bowling attack, letting go of their iconic trio&mdash;<strong>Ashwin, Chahal, and Boult</strong>&mdash;and bringing in the fiery pace of <strong>Jofra Archer</strong>, alongside spin wizards <strong>Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana</strong>. Adding to the intrigue is the arrival of <strong>13-year-old prodigy Suryavanshi,</strong> making headlines as the youngest-ever IPL recruit!</p>

<p><span style=""color:#e67e22""><strong>Hyderabad &ndash; A Ground Where Trends Are Shifting!</strong></span></p>

<p><br />
As <strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR)</strong> prepare for their <strong>IPL 2025 clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium</strong>, the stats reveal an intriguing narrative. Historically, <strong>teams chasing have had the upper hand</strong>, winning <strong>43 out of 77 matches</strong>, while <strong>teams batting first have secured 34 victories</strong>. The <strong>average first-innings score has been 163</strong>, with teams managing <strong>47 runs in the powerplay</strong> and <strong>43 in the death overs</strong> on average.</p>

<p>But hold on&mdash;<strong>the past two seasons have flipped the script!</strong> In the <strong>last 13 IPL games played here</strong>, teams batting first have gained an <strong>edge with 7 wins compared to 6 for chasing sides</strong>. More importantly, the <strong>batting-friendly conditions have led to an increase in scoring</strong>, with the <strong>average first-innings total soaring to 189!</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>powerplay has seen fireworks, with teams now averaging 56 runs</strong>, while the <strong>death overs have become even more explosive, pushing the scoring rate to 49 runs on average.</strong> Clearly, Hyderabad is no longer just a <strong>chasing-friendly venue</strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s now a <strong>high-scoring battleground</strong> where teams will need to rethink their strategies.</p>

<p>With SRH&rsquo;s <strong>explosive top order</strong> and RR&rsquo;s <strong>revamped power-hitting unit</strong>, this match promises to be an absolute run-fest! <strong>Will the trend of big first-innings totals continue, or will the chasing team regain its dominance?</strong> Buckle up&mdash;Hyderabad is set for a thrilling contest!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pitch Report | Mpumelelo Mbangwa and Michael Clarke:</strong><br />
&quot;Dimensions-wise, the square boundaries are 63m and 70m, with 76m straight down the ground. The average score at this venue is 205, but on this specific pitch, it&#39;s even higher at 216. In one word, it&rsquo;s a batting paradise &mdash; an absolute belter, and it has been for quite some time.If we&#39;re nitpicking, both ends of the pitch appear slightly dry, while the center has a touch more grass. That could hint at a bit of two-paced behavior or some grip for spinners &mdash; we&rsquo;re hoping! But make no mistake, with this heat and this surface, it&#39;s the batters who will be licking their lips.If you&#39;re batting first here, 200+ should be the minimum target. It&#39;s tough for a surface to deteriorate in a 20-over match, but ideally, the second innings might offer some grip &mdash; slower balls and spin could come into play. Bottom line: expect runs, and lots of them.&quot;<br />

<p>After being sent in to bat, <strong>SRH unleashed carnage</strong>, posting a <strong>mammoth 286/6</strong>&mdash;one of the highest team totals in IPL history! The charge was led by the ever-destructive <strong>Ishan Kishan</strong>, who blazed his way to an <strong>unbeaten 106 off just 47 balls</strong>. He was well supported by <strong>Travis Head (67 off 39)</strong> and <strong>Nitish Reddy (30 off 15)</strong>, as SRH&rsquo;s top order tore apart the Royals&#39; bowling.</p>

<p>Despite <strong>RR&rsquo;s bold bowling changes this season</strong>, including pace spearhead <strong>Jofra Archer</strong> and mystery spinner <strong>Theekshana</strong>, their attack had no answers. <strong>Tushar Deshpande</strong> tried to pull things back with <strong>3 wickets</strong>, but the scoreboard pressure was already massive.</p>

<p>Chasing 287, <strong>RR began disastrously</strong>, losing <strong>Jaiswal and skipper Riyan Parag</strong> in the very first two overs. However, <strong>Sanju Samson (66 off 37)</strong> and <strong>Hetmyer (42 off 23)</strong> tried to revive the innings, while <strong>Dhruv Jurel&rsquo;s explosive 70 off 35</strong> gave them hope. But the mountain was just too steep.</p>

<p><strong>Harshal Patel (2/34)</strong> and <strong>Simarjeet Singh (2/46)</strong> struck at key moments to seal the deal for SRH, restricting RR to <strong>242/6</strong> in their 20 overs.<br />

&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Riyan Parag (RR Captain):</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#ff0099""><strong>&quot;It was tough &mdash; just as I expected. I think we could&rsquo;ve executed our plans a lot better, and that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll sit down and discuss as a team.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#ff0099""><strong>(On choosing to bowl first):<br />
&quot;It was a collective decision. The idea was to use the slower balls and bouncers more effectively, but we definitely could&rsquo;ve done a better job with that.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#ff0099""><strong>&quot;When you&#39;re chasing 280, it&rsquo;s always going to be tough. Honestly, I felt a target around 220&ndash;240 would have been more manageable.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#ff0099""><strong>&quot;That said, the batters looked great &mdash; Sanju bhaiya gave us a good start, Dhruv Jurel played a superb innings, and Sandeep bowled really well. Lots of positives to take from this match. Win or lose, we&rsquo;ll take the learnings and move forward.&quot;</strong></span><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pat Cummins (Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain):</strong><br />
<strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">(On being called the most feared side in the IPL):<br />
&quot;I&rsquo;ll take that! Honestly, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be bowling to our batters &mdash; they&rsquo;re unbelievable. Putting up 280-plus is scary. You know you&#39;re going to go for runs, and it&#39;s never easy out there. But when you have that kind of total, one big over can change the game in your favor.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;We&#39;ve largely retained our core group, and I&rsquo;m really happy with the new additions. Ishan was just incredible today &mdash; what a knock!&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;The preparation leading into the season has been top-notch. Credit to our coaches &mdash; they&#39;ve been fantastic. Everyone came in fit and firing. We&rsquo;ve created an environment where guys are encouraged to play with freedom &mdash; and while that&rsquo;s easier said than done, the results speak for themselves.&quot;</span></strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ishan Kishan (Player of the Match):</strong><br />
<strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;To be honest, there were nerves definitely. But looking at the score and the team setup, Pat and the coach gave me a lot of confidence. They told me, &#39;Just believe in yourself and enjoy out there.&#39; And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did &mdash; I just enjoyed my time in the middle.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;I had a good amount of time off between games, and I worked really hard during that period. I gave it everything in practice. A few close people stood by me and helped me stay focused. I just believed in my game and backed myself.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">(On whether he wants to carry this pitch with him everywhere):<br />
&quot;100 percent! When you see Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head batting the way they did, and you&#39;re coming in at No. 3, it gives you so much confidence. You know you can take your time because those two won&rsquo;t stop. You&rsquo;re either walking in very early or with a huge total already on the board &mdash; both situations help you settle in.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;Of course, posting these kinds of totals every match is tough. But Pat knows what&rsquo;s best for the team. The message is clear &mdash; go out, play with freedom, and enjoy yourself. Don&rsquo;t worry about getting out &mdash; just express yourself.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
It&#39;s a fresh chapter for both franchises, with <strong>new captains and revamped squads</strong>, setting the stage for an electrifying contest. <strong>Ajinkya Rahane takes the reins for KKR</strong>, while <strong>Rajat Patidar leads RCB</strong>, marking a bold new era for both teams.</p>

<p><br />
The subplots couldn&rsquo;t get any juicier! <strong>Phil Salt</strong>, who was a game-changer for KKR last season, will now be lining up against them in RCB colors. Alongside <strong>Livingstone, Tim David, and Kohli</strong>, RCB&rsquo;s batting arsenal looks nothing short of firepower.</p>

<p><br />
But the Knights are ready to defend their fortress! <strong>Venkatesh Iyer</strong>, KKR&rsquo;s biggest acquisition, will be their key player, while the legendary duo of <strong>Andre Russell and Sunil Narine</strong> remains the backbone of their success. Can they deliver yet again?</p>

<p><br />
As <strong>KKR and RCB</strong> gear up for the <strong>IPL 2025 opener</strong>, all eyes will be on the pitch at <strong>Eden Gardens</strong>, a venue known for its electric atmosphere and shifting trends. Over the years, teams <strong>chasing have held the edge</strong>, winning <strong>55 out of 93 games</strong>, compared to <strong>38 victories for teams batting first</strong>.</p>

<p>Historically, the <strong>average first-innings score here stands at 167</strong>, with a <strong>powerplay average of 49 runs</strong> and a <strong>death overs surge of 45 runs</strong>. However, the past <strong>three seasons have rewritten the script!</strong></p>

<p>In the <strong>last 16 IPL games</strong> at this venue, teams batting first and second have split the wins <strong>evenly at 8 each</strong>, signaling a <strong>balanced contest</strong>. More significantly, the <strong>average first-innings total has skyrocketed to 196</strong>, proving that Eden Gardens is no longer just about chasing&mdash;it&rsquo;s now a <strong>big-hitting paradise!</strong></p>

<p>With power-packed lineups on both sides, <strong>will KKR&rsquo;s all-rounders dominate the show, or will RCB&rsquo;s batting might make Eden their own?</strong> One thing is certain&mdash;<strong>fans are in for a run-fest!<br />

<p><strong>Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) kicked off their IPL 2025 campaign with a commanding seven-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at Eden Gardens, finishing the chase with a whopping 22 balls to spare. In what was billed as a highly anticipated opener, RCB outclassed the home side in all departments, signaling the beginning of a new era under captain Rajat Patidar.</strong></p>

<p><strong>After winning the toss and opting to bowl first, RCB had an early scare when Suyash Sharma dropped a sitter in the opening over, giving Quinton de Kock a life. However, Josh Hazlewood dismissed him a few balls later, ensuring the drop didn&rsquo;t cost them. KKR bounced back with a brilliant 103-run stand between new skipper Ajinkya Rahane and Sunil Narine. Rahane looked elegant in his 56 off 31, while Narine bludgeoned 44 off 26. But once Narine fell to Rasikh Dar Salam, the innings lost momentum. Krunal Pandya took charge with the ball, picking 3 for 29, and KKR stumbled to 174/8.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In response, RCB&rsquo;s chase was nothing short of explosive. Phil Salt, facing his former team, went ballistic in the powerplay, scoring 56 off 31 balls, while Virat Kohli, playing his 400th T20 match, remained unbeaten on 59 from 36 deliveries. The pair&rsquo;s 80-run opening stand in six overs completely deflated the KKR attack. Despite losing Salt and Padikkal, Patidar smashed a 16-ball 34, and Livingstone wrapped things up with a rapid 15* off 5 balls.</strong></p>

<p><strong>RCB&#39;s intent was clear &mdash; fearless batting, tight bowling, and capitalizing on big moments. For KKR, this was a wake-up call, especially with the ball, as they failed to defend a competitive total. As the tournament begins to unfold, RCB already look like a well-oiled unit ready to go the distance.</strong><br />

<strong>Ajinkya Rahane | Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>&quot;I thought we were in a strong position until around the 13th over, but then we lost two to three wickets in quick succession, and the momentum completely shifted. It&rsquo;s just the first game of the season, so we&rsquo;ll assess things quickly and move forward.Yes, while I was batting with Venkatesh, we felt 210&ndash;220 was very much on the cards. But credit to RCB &mdash; they bowled exceptionally well in the latter half of our innings.There was a bit of dew, yes, but more than that, I think they batted brilliantly in the powerplay. As I mentioned earlier, a total of 170&ndash;180 on this surface was below par. We were targeting 200-plus, and not getting early breakthroughs with the ball really hurt us tonight.That said, we&rsquo;re not going to dwell too much on this result. It&rsquo;s a long season. We&rsquo;ll regroup, improve as a unit, and come back stronger in the upcoming matches.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | Royal Challengers &nbsp;Bengaluru&nbsp;Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&quot;There was definitely pressure, but it turned out to be a good day for me &mdash; and if we keep playing like this, I hope there are many more to come.The plan was very clear. I wanted the wicket of Andre Russell at any cost. Even if Suyash went for a few runs, I backed him as our strike bowler &mdash; and he delivered. That moment was crucial.Both Krunal and Suyash deserve massive credit. KKR were flying around the 13th over, but the way they pulled things back was simply brilliant. Their composure turned the game in our favour.It&rsquo;s also a great feeling to lead someone like Virat Kohli &mdash; he&rsquo;s incredibly supportive and having that kind of experience in the camp helps a lot. I&rsquo;m learning every day with this group of leaders around me.&nbsp;Yeah, that was actually a premeditated shot &mdash; I was aiming to go over cover, but the ball nipped back a bit, and it ended up flying over backward point instead. Luckily, it worked out!&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Krunal Pandya | Player of the Match:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&quot;Honestly, nothing much &mdash; I just realised that with so much crowd noise, it&rsquo;s important to narrow your focus. When I came back to bowl my second over, I zoned in and just focused on delivering good balls. I&rsquo;m happy I could step up and contribute for the team.In T20s, if batters want to go big, they&rsquo;ll have to do it against my best deliveries. That&rsquo;s the mindset. These days, batters have so many options and skills &mdash; as a bowler, you&rsquo;ve got to keep evolving with the game. Everyone talks about changes of pace &mdash; usually about pacers &mdash; but for spinners too, variation in speed is a powerful weapon. I&rsquo;ve got a wide yorker and even a bouncer in my toolkit, and Jitesh Sharma is well aware of that. He&rsquo;s always ready, which gives me the confidence to execute those variations when needed. Joining RCB has been incredible. The energy around this franchise is unreal. Even when I played domestic cricket in Bengaluru, I could hear RCB chants from the stands. It&rsquo;s been only ten days with the squad, but it already feels like something special.&quot;</strong></span></p>
