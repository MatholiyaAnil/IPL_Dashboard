<p><strong>Pitch Report | Daren Ganga and Shane Watson:</strong><br />
<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Royals taking on the Knight Riders here in Guwahati &mdash; a venue that doesn&rsquo;t have a rich IPL history just yet. Let&rsquo;s jump straight into the dimensions: it&rsquo;s 76 meters down the ground, with square boundaries measuring 64 meters on either side &mdash; so fairly balanced, no real bias for the captains to consider. The Royals went with just one specialist spinner in their last game here.&nbsp;Just looking at the surface, it&rsquo;s quite dry, and there isn&rsquo;t much grass cover, especially away from the central strip near the crease. That&rsquo;s a clear sign. Since 2021, the average first-innings score here in T20s is 163, which tells us the pitch tends to slow down slightly. And, importantly, teams batting first have won six out of seven matches at this venue. So, expect the surface to dry out further &mdash; and expect spin to have a real impact tonight.&rdquo;</p>

Gujarat aren&#39;t just a team; they&#39;re a winning machine.<strong> With Shubman Gill at the helm, they&#39;ve got a squad that screams championship DNA. The big-ticket acquisition of Jos Buttler adds serious firepower to an already lethal lineup. </strong>Throw in Rashid Khan&#39;s magic and new bowling weapons like Kagiso Rabada and Mohammed Siraj, and you&#39;ve got a nightmare matchup for any opposition. Punjab Kings are the perennial underdogs with a star-studded reset. <strong>Shreyas Iyer&#39;s leadership and Ricky Ponting&#39;s</strong> <strong>coaching </strong>create a potent mix of aggression and strategy. With Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis in the middle order, they&#39;ve got match-winners who can turn games on their head. Yuzvendra Chahal&#39;s spin and Lockie Ferguson&#39;s pace add serious international class. <strong>Narendra Modi Stadium is no ordinary ground. Last season saw dramatic shifts &ndash; teams bundled out for under 100 or sailing past 199. </strong>The&nbsp;Gujarat Titans look more settled, but in the IPL, never write off an underdog. <strong>Punjab Kings aren&#39;t just playing to compete but to prove a point. Buckle up for a cracker of a match.<br />

<p><strong>Pitch Report | Matthew Hayden &amp; Eoin Morgan</strong><br />
&quot;We&rsquo;re standing on pitch number six today, and it&rsquo;s an absolute beauty. This is a relatively compact ground &mdash; just 64 meters to my left, 66 meters to my right, and 72 meters straight down the ground.&nbsp;Morgs, what&rsquo;s your take on tonight&rsquo;s surface? This pitch looks pristine &mdash; a lovely even covering of grass which is always a sign of consistent bounce. From my experience, when it looks this good at this venue, there&rsquo;s little for batters to fear. If the ball comes on nicely, expect plenty of boundaries cleared tonight.The stats back that up too. The average first-innings score here is 185, and we&rsquo;ve seen teams cross 200 in 10 of the last 17 games. Dew is expected later tonight, so if you win the toss.You absolutely chase. That&rsquo;s the advantage here. But even if you&rsquo;re sent in to bat first, don&rsquo;t panic &mdash; this surface is a batter&rsquo;s paradise. Get ahead early and keep pushing. Either way, it&rsquo;s a high-scoring contest in the making.&quot;<br />

<p><strong>In a match where boundaries rained and bowlers prayed, Punjab Kings pulled off a high-octane 11-run win over Gujarat Titans in a clash that had everything &mdash; blistering strokes, brain-fade dismissals, and a final-over twist.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer led from the front, nearly scripting a T20 masterclass with an unbeaten 97 off 42 balls, smashing 9 sixes and turning Narendra Modi Stadium</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>into a launchpad. He was brilliantly supported by Priyansh Arya&rsquo;s fearless 47 and Shashank Singh&rsquo;s 16-ball 44, as Punjab piled up a towering 243/5.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Titans, though, came swinging. Sai Sudharsan lit it up with a classy 74, while Jos Buttler&rsquo;s 54 off 33 kept the game on a knife&rsquo;s edge. Then came Sherfane Rutherford, smashing his way to 46, nearly stealing it. But Arshdeep Singh held his nerve, picking two vital scalps and deflecting a heartbreaking run-out of Tewatia to turn the tide.</strong></p>

<p><strong>With 27 needed off the last over, GT&rsquo;s fire fizzled as Arshdeep cleaned up Rutherford, sealing the win.<br />

&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shubman Gill | Gujarat Titans Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>&quot;Yeah, I think we had our moments &mdash; both while bowling and batting &mdash; but we let ourselves down in the field. Dropping those chances definitely hurt us, and chasing a target like that was always going to be tough.There was a crucial phase in the middle where we only managed around 18 runs in three overs. Even at the start, we didn&rsquo;t get going &mdash; scored just about 30-40 in the first three overs. That patch probably cost us in the end. Still, I&rsquo;d say there were a lot of positives for us to take, and it&rsquo;s a good starting point for the season&nbsp;It&rsquo;s never easy coming in cold as an impact player after sitting for 15-16 overs and executing yorkers under pressure. Full credit to him and the others for the way they bowled at the death.This is always a high-scoring ground. You might post 230 or even 240 here, but the real challenge is in defending it. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll need to address moving forward.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer | Punjab Kings Captain &amp; Player of the Match:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&quot;Ecstatic, to be honest. Getting 97* in the first match &mdash; that&rsquo;s just the icing on the cake. There&rsquo;s no better feeling. For me, it was all about adapting quickly. That first boundary off the first ball gave me a massive confidence boost. And that flicked six off Rabada &mdash; I feel like that&rsquo;s when the momentum shifted in our favor.There was a bit of extra bounce early on, but we adapted really well. Shashank&rsquo;s knock &mdash; 44 off just 16 or 17 balls &mdash; was incredible. With the dew setting in, we knew the conditions would tilt slightly, so it was all about execution, and I&rsquo;m glad we did that.Vyshak is such a character &mdash; funny, but with a brilliant attitude. He brings great energy, and it was fantastic to see him bowl with such intent. Arshdeep played a key role too. He mentioned the ball was reversing slightly, and even saliva was helping with that.We&rsquo;ve done a lot of groundwork before the season &mdash; left no stone unturned. Everyone&rsquo;s contributing not just with skill, but with mindset and intent. That&rsquo;s what makes the environment really special.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p>With <strong>Axar Patel</strong> taking Delhi&#39;s captaincy reins, both teams enter a new era following extensive squad revamps.

<p><strong>Pitch Report | Pommie Mbangwa and WV Raman:</strong><br />
&quot;It&#39;s a nice surface today, especially considering the atmospheric conditions. There was a slight rain threat, but we hope it stays away. Look at the dimensions: square boundaries at 62m each, a straight hit reaching 73m, and just 56m behind me. WV Raman, what do you make of this surface?<br />
The pitch is rolled to perfection&mdash;hard, even, and with very little grass, thanks to a month-long nonstop preparation by the curator. Normally, tracks here yield plenty of runs, and tonight will be no different.&quot;</p>

<p>In a high-scoring, edge-of-the-seat thriller at Vizag, <strong>Delhi Capitals</strong> stunned <strong>Lucknow Super Giants</strong> by <strong>1 wicket</strong> with <strong>3 balls to spare</strong>, chasing down a daunting target of <strong>210</strong> in a game that ebbed and flowed right until the final over.</p>

<p>Earlier, LSG rode on blistering half-centuries from <strong>Mitchell Marsh (72 off 36)</strong> and <strong>Nicholas Pooran (75 off 30)</strong> to post <strong>209/8</strong>. The duo launched a brutal assault in the middle overs, hammering 13 sixes between them and propelling LSG past 200. However, DC clawed back late with <strong>Mitchell Starc (3/42)</strong> and <strong>Kuldeep Yadav (2/20)</strong> keeping things in check. The collapse in the final five overs &mdash; where LSG lost 6 wickets for 46 runs &mdash; ultimately proved costly.</p>

<p>In response, Delhi got off to a nightmare start, losing their top three inside the first two overs. But from 7/3, the Capitals showed remarkable character. <strong>Ashutosh Sharma</strong>, promoted as an Impact Player, played the innings of a lifetime, smashing an unbeaten <strong>66 off 31 balls</strong>, including 5 sixes and 5 fours.</p>

<p>He found support from <strong>Vipraj Nigam (39 off 15)</strong> as the pair stitched a crucial 55-run stand that brought DC back into the contest. The game came down to the final over, with 6 needed. Ashutosh, calm under pressure, smoked a six to seal a remarkable win.<br />

<p><strong>Rishabh Pant | Lucknow Super Giants Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#2980b9""><strong>&quot;I think we had enough runs on the board. The batters did really well, but we lost some momentum between overs 13 to 17. Still, it was a competitive total on this surface.As a team, we&#39;re looking to take positives from every game. The more we stick to the basics, the better it will be for us going forward.It&rsquo;s quite clear where it slipped away. This was a good wicket to bat on, and they had two key partnerships &mdash; Stubbsy, Ashutosh, and another guy &mdash; that really took the game away from us.As the ball got older, there was more on offer for the bowlers. We felt the pressure in the final phase. It&#39;s still early in the tournament, and while pressure is part of the game, so is learning from moments like this.Of course, luck plays its part. If that ball had missed the pad, it was a stumping chance. But you can&rsquo;t dwell on these things. The focus has to be on playing good, consistent cricket from here on.&quot;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Axar Patel | Delhi Capitals Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&quot;Under my captaincy, you might see a few more thrillers like this!&nbsp;We got the win, so let&rsquo;s not overthink things like why Stubbs bowled or anything like that. After losing four wickets inside the powerplay, it was an outstanding effort from the boys to pull it back and chase this down.Since last year, with the impact player rule, we&rsquo;ve seen this shift. Bowlers are getting hit, but they&rsquo;re also picking up wickets. You have to be mentally ready for that &mdash; if you&#39;re being attacked, there&rsquo;s always a chance to strike back.To be honest, we gave away a few extra runs in the powerplay and dropped some catches too. At one point, it looked like they were heading for 240-250. But the way we bowled in the last seven overs &mdash; giving just 40-odd &mdash; that was a brilliant comeback.We&rsquo;ve been in camp for over a week now, and everyone understands each other&rsquo;s strengths. We saw potential in Vipraj Nigam &mdash; and tonight, he showed why we backed him. I&rsquo;m confident he&rsquo;ll keep growing and deliver in the games to come.&quot;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ashutosh Sharma | Player of the Match:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&quot;Honestly, this is something I&rsquo;ve been working on since last season. There were a couple of games where I took it deep but couldn&rsquo;t finish &mdash; got out at the wrong time. That stayed with me, and over the past year, I&rsquo;ve made it a focus &mdash; especially in domestic cricket, trying to finish games consistently.I have a lot of belief in myself. I knew that if I could take it into the last over, anything was possible. In T20 cricket, once the equation narrows down, pressure shifts. I just backed the shots I&rsquo;ve been practicing in the nets &mdash; nothing fancy, just execution and self-belief.First of all, hats off to Vipraj &mdash; what a knock! I just kept telling him: if you&#39;re confident you can find the boundary, back yourself and go for it. We kept talking throughout, kept each other calm, and that made a big difference.More than anything, I just wanted to put into play all the hard work I&#39;ve done in training. I&rsquo;m really happy to contribute and would love to dedicate this award to my mentor, Shikhar Paaji (Dhawan), who&rsquo;s not here today but has played a big role in my journey.&quot;</strong></span></p>

It&rsquo;s the <strong>El Clasico of the IPL</strong> as <strong>Chennai Super Kings (CSK) take on Mumbai Indians (MI) in Match No. 3 at Chepauk!</strong></p>

<p><strong>MI will be led by Suryakumar Yadav,</strong> stepping in for Hardik Pandya, who serves a one-match ban for a slow over-rate from last season&rsquo;s final league game. With <strong>Rohit Sharma, Tilak Varma, and SKY</strong> forming a formidable batting trio, MI will aim for a strong start. However, the absence of <strong>Jasprit Bumrah for the initial few games</strong> could be a concern for them. Interestingly, <strong>CSK&rsquo;s former all-rounder Mitchell Santner</strong> will be donning MI colors this year, adding an intriguing subplot to the contest.</p>

<p><strong>CSK, on the other hand, have revamped their squad while retaining their core.</strong> The legendary <strong>MS Dhoni, along with Ravindra Jadeja, Matheesha Pathirana, and Shivam Dube,</strong> hold the key to their success. Under the yellow floodlights of Chepauk, the Super Kings will be eager to start their campaign with a bang, backed by the ever-passionate <strong>Whistle Podu Army!</strong></p>

<p>With <strong>power-hitters, world-class bowlers, and a history of nail-biters,</strong> this clash is set to be a <strong>high-voltage showdown!</strong> Will CSK dominate at home, or will MI silence the Chennai crowd? <strong>Fasten your seatbelts&mdash;the IPL rivalry is back!<br />

&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav (MI Captain):</strong><br />
<strong><span style=""color:#2980b9"">&quot;Absolutely. We were probably 15&ndash;20 runs short, but the fight the boys showed out there was commendable. That&rsquo;s what MI is known for &mdash; giving opportunities to youngsters and backing them. The scouts work hard for 10 months a year, and Vignesh is a brilliant product of that process.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#2980b9"">&quot;I had one over from him up my sleeve in case the game went deep, and when it did, it was a no-brainer to hand him the 18th. He showed great temperament.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#2980b9"">&quot;There wasn&rsquo;t much dew, but the pitch was a bit sticky. Credit to Ruturaj &mdash; the way he batted in the second innings took the game away from us.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#2980b9"">&quot;It&rsquo;s still early days in the tournament. There&rsquo;s a long way to go.&quot;</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad (CSK Captain):</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;Happy to be on the winning side. Of course, we would&rsquo;ve liked to be a bit more clinical, but that&rsquo;s how the game goes sometimes.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;The role I&rsquo;m playing is based on the team&rsquo;s requirements, and if it brings better balance, I&rsquo;m more than happy to adapt and change my position. It&rsquo;s all about what&rsquo;s best for the team.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;The spinners were spot on tonight. Right after the auction, one of the things we were most excited about was seeing all three of them &mdash; bowling in tandem at Chepauk. That&rsquo;s a big strength for us.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;Khaleel brings a lot of experience, and Noor is a true X-factor &mdash; that&rsquo;s exactly why we wanted him in the squad. And it&rsquo;s always great to have someone like Ash in the mix as well.&quot;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Noor Ahmad (Player of the Match):</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;It feels really special to play here in the IPL. I&#39;m happy for the team and pleased with my contribution today.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;The main focus was to keep it simple &mdash; just land the ball in the right areas. The wicket of Surya was a big one, and that stumping by MSD... it was out of this world!&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong>&quot;Having Mahi bhai behind the stumps is an incredible support. His presence, experience, and guidance give me a lot of confidence out there. It feels great to be part of this setup.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#e67e22""><strong>Hyderabad &ndash; A Ground Where Trends Are Shifting!</strong></span></p>

<p><br />
As <strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR)</strong> prepare for their <strong>IPL 2025 clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium</strong>, the stats reveal an intriguing narrative. Historically, <strong>teams chasing have had the upper hand</strong>, winning <strong>43 out of 77 matches</strong>, while <strong>teams batting first have secured 34 victories</strong>. The <strong>average first-innings score has been 163</strong>, with teams managing <strong>47 runs in the powerplay</strong> and <strong>43 in the death overs</strong> on average.</p>

<p>But hold on&mdash;<strong>the past two seasons have flipped the script!</strong> In the <strong>last 13 IPL games played here</strong>, teams batting first have gained an <strong>edge with 7 wins compared to 6 for chasing sides</strong>. More importantly, the <strong>batting-friendly conditions have led to an increase in scoring</strong>, with the <strong>average first-innings total soaring to 189!</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>powerplay has seen fireworks, with teams now averaging 56 runs</strong>, while the <strong>death overs have become even more explosive, pushing the scoring rate to 49 runs on average.</strong> Clearly, Hyderabad is no longer just a <strong>chasing-friendly venue</strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s now a <strong>high-scoring battleground</strong> where teams will need to rethink their strategies.</p>

<p>With SRH&rsquo;s <strong>explosive top order</strong> and RR&rsquo;s <strong>revamped power-hitting unit</strong>, this match promises to be an absolute run-fest! <strong>Will the trend of big first-innings totals continue, or will the chasing team regain its dominance?</strong> Buckle up&mdash;Hyderabad is set for a thrilling contest!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pitch Report | Mpumelelo Mbangwa and Michael Clarke:</strong><br />
&quot;Dimensions-wise, the square boundaries are 63m and 70m, with 76m straight down the ground. The average score at this venue is 205, but on this specific pitch, it&#39;s even higher at 216. In one word, it&rsquo;s a batting paradise &mdash; an absolute belter, and it has been for quite some time.If we&#39;re nitpicking, both ends of the pitch appear slightly dry, while the center has a touch more grass. That could hint at a bit of two-paced behavior or some grip for spinners &mdash; we&rsquo;re hoping! But make no mistake, with this heat and this surface, it&#39;s the batters who will be licking their lips.If you&#39;re batting first here, 200+ should be the minimum target. It&#39;s tough for a surface to deteriorate in a 20-over match, but ideally, the second innings might offer some grip &mdash; slower balls and spin could come into play. Bottom line: expect runs, and lots of them.&quot;<br />

<p>What a spectacle at the <strong>Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium</strong> as <span style=""color:#d35400""><strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad (<img alt="""" src=""https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png"" style=""height:18px; width:40px"" title="""" />)</strong></span> launched their IPL 2025 campaign in <strong>explosive style</strong>, crushing <span style=""color:#ff0099""><strong>Rajasthan Royals (<img alt="""" src=""https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png"" style=""height:20px; width:31px"" title="""" />)</strong></span> by <strong>44 runs</strong> in a high-scoring thriller!</p>

<p>After being sent in to bat, <strong>SRH unleashed carnage</strong>, posting a <strong>mammoth 286/6</strong>&mdash;one of the highest team totals in IPL history! The charge was led by the ever-destructive <strong>Ishan Kishan</strong>, who blazed his way to an <strong>unbeaten 106 off just 47 balls</strong>. He was well supported by <strong>Travis Head (67 off 39)</strong> and <strong>Nitish Reddy (30 off 15)</strong>, as SRH&rsquo;s top order tore apart the Royals&#39; bowling.</p>

<p>Despite <strong>RR&rsquo;s bold bowling changes this season</strong>, including pace spearhead <strong>Jofra Archer</strong> and mystery spinner <strong>Theekshana</strong>, their attack had no answers. <strong>Tushar Deshpande</strong> tried to pull things back with <strong>3 wickets</strong>, but the scoreboard pressure was already massive.</p>

<p>Chasing 287, <strong>RR began disastrously</strong>, losing <strong>Jaiswal and skipper Riyan Parag</strong> in the very first two overs. However, <strong>Sanju Samson (66 off 37)</strong> and <strong>Hetmyer (42 off 23)</strong> tried to revive the innings, while <strong>Dhruv Jurel&rsquo;s explosive 70 off 35</strong> gave them hope. But the mountain was just too steep.</p>

<p><strong>Harshal Patel (2/34)</strong> and <strong>Simarjeet Singh (2/46)</strong> struck at key moments to seal the deal for SRH, restricting RR to <strong>242/6</strong> in their 20 overs.<br />

&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Riyan Parag (RR Captain):</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#ff0099""><strong>&quot;It was tough &mdash; just as I expected. I think we could&rsquo;ve executed our plans a lot better, and that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll sit down and discuss as a team.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#ff0099""><strong>(On choosing to bowl first):<br />
&quot;It was a collective decision. The idea was to use the slower balls and bouncers more effectively, but we definitely could&rsquo;ve done a better job with that.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#ff0099""><strong>&quot;When you&#39;re chasing 280, it&rsquo;s always going to be tough. Honestly, I felt a target around 220&ndash;240 would have been more manageable.&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#ff0099""><strong>&quot;That said, the batters looked great &mdash; Sanju bhaiya gave us a good start, Dhruv Jurel played a superb innings, and Sandeep bowled really well. Lots of positives to take from this match. Win or lose, we&rsquo;ll take the learnings and move forward.&quot;</strong></span><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pat Cummins (Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain):</strong><br />
<strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">(On being called the most feared side in the IPL):<br />
&quot;I&rsquo;ll take that! Honestly, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be bowling to our batters &mdash; they&rsquo;re unbelievable. Putting up 280-plus is scary. You know you&#39;re going to go for runs, and it&#39;s never easy out there. But when you have that kind of total, one big over can change the game in your favor.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;We&#39;ve largely retained our core group, and I&rsquo;m really happy with the new additions. Ishan was just incredible today &mdash; what a knock!&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;The preparation leading into the season has been top-notch. Credit to our coaches &mdash; they&#39;ve been fantastic. Everyone came in fit and firing. We&rsquo;ve created an environment where guys are encouraged to play with freedom &mdash; and while that&rsquo;s easier said than done, the results speak for themselves.&quot;</span></strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ishan Kishan (Player of the Match):</strong><br />
<strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;To be honest, there were nerves definitely. But looking at the score and the team setup, Pat and the coach gave me a lot of confidence. They told me, &#39;Just believe in yourself and enjoy out there.&#39; And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did &mdash; I just enjoyed my time in the middle.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;I had a good amount of time off between games, and I worked really hard during that period. I gave it everything in practice. A few close people stood by me and helped me stay focused. I just believed in my game and backed myself.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">(On whether he wants to carry this pitch with him everywhere):<br />
&quot;100 percent! When you see Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head batting the way they did, and you&#39;re coming in at No. 3, it gives you so much confidence. You know you can take your time because those two won&rsquo;t stop. You&rsquo;re either walking in very early or with a huge total already on the board &mdash; both situations help you settle in.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color:#d35400"">&quot;Of course, posting these kinds of totals every match is tough. But Pat knows what&rsquo;s best for the team. The message is clear &mdash; go out, play with freedom, and enjoy yourself. Don&rsquo;t worry about getting out &mdash; just express yourself.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
It&#39;s a fresh chapter for both franchises, with <strong>new captains and revamped squads</strong>, setting the stage for an electrifying contest. <strong>Ajinkya Rahane takes the reins for KKR</strong>, while <strong>Rajat Patidar leads RCB</strong>, marking a bold new era for both teams.</p>

<p><br />
The subplots couldn&rsquo;t get any juicier! <strong>Phil Salt</strong>, who was a game-changer for KKR last season, will now be lining up against them in RCB colors. Alongside <strong>Livingstone, Tim David, and Kohli</strong>, RCB&rsquo;s batting arsenal looks nothing short of firepower.</p>

<p><br />
But the Knights are ready to defend their fortress! <strong>Venkatesh Iyer</strong>, KKR&rsquo;s biggest acquisition, will be their key player, while the legendary duo of <strong>Andre Russell and Sunil Narine</strong> remains the backbone of their success. Can they deliver yet again?</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Who will draw first blood in IPL 2025? Will KKR start their title defense with a bang, or will RCB spoil the party at Eden?</strong> Get ready for a night of <strong>thrills, fireworks, and nail-biting drama</strong> as two of the league&rsquo;s powerhouses collide in a dream opener!&nbsp;<br />

<br />
<strong><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">Eden Gardens &ndash; A Batting Paradise or a Test of Strategy?</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
As <strong>KKR and RCB</strong> gear up for the <strong>IPL 2025 opener</strong>, all eyes will be on the pitch at <strong>Eden Gardens</strong>, a venue known for its electric atmosphere and shifting trends. Over the years, teams <strong>chasing have held the edge</strong>, winning <strong>55 out of 93 games</strong>, compared to <strong>38 victories for teams batting first</strong>.</p>

<p>Historically, the <strong>average first-innings score here stands at 167</strong>, with a <strong>powerplay average of 49 runs</strong> and a <strong>death overs surge of 45 runs</strong>. However, the past <strong>three seasons have rewritten the script!</strong></p>

<p>In the <strong>last 16 IPL games</strong> at this venue, teams batting first and second have split the wins <strong>evenly at 8 each</strong>, signaling a <strong>balanced contest</strong>. More significantly, the <strong>average first-innings total has skyrocketed to 196</strong>, proving that Eden Gardens is no longer just about chasing&mdash;it&rsquo;s now a <strong>big-hitting paradise!</strong></p>

<p>With power-packed lineups on both sides, <strong>will KKR&rsquo;s all-rounders dominate the show, or will RCB&rsquo;s batting might make Eden their own?</strong> One thing is certain&mdash;<strong>fans are in for a run-fest!<br />

&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) kicked off their IPL 2025 campaign with a commanding seven-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at Eden Gardens, finishing the chase with a whopping 22 balls to spare. In what was billed as a highly anticipated opener, RCB outclassed the home side in all departments, signaling the beginning of a new era under captain Rajat Patidar.</strong></p>

<p><strong>After winning the toss and opting to bowl first, RCB had an early scare when Suyash Sharma dropped a sitter in the opening over, giving Quinton de Kock a life. However, Josh Hazlewood dismissed him a few balls later, ensuring the drop didn&rsquo;t cost them. KKR bounced back with a brilliant 103-run stand between new skipper Ajinkya Rahane and Sunil Narine. Rahane looked elegant in his 56 off 31, while Narine bludgeoned 44 off 26. But once Narine fell to Rasikh Dar Salam, the innings lost momentum. Krunal Pandya took charge with the ball, picking 3 for 29, and KKR stumbled to 174/8.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In response, RCB&rsquo;s chase was nothing short of explosive. Phil Salt, facing his former team, went ballistic in the powerplay, scoring 56 off 31 balls, while Virat Kohli, playing his 400th T20 match, remained unbeaten on 59 from 36 deliveries. The pair&rsquo;s 80-run opening stand in six overs completely deflated the KKR attack. Despite losing Salt and Padikkal, Patidar smashed a 16-ball 34, and Livingstone wrapped things up with a rapid 15* off 5 balls.</strong></p>

<p><strong>RCB&#39;s intent was clear &mdash; fearless batting, tight bowling, and capitalizing on big moments. For KKR, this was a wake-up call, especially with the ball, as they failed to defend a competitive total. As the tournament begins to unfold, RCB already look like a well-oiled unit ready to go the distance.</strong><br />

<p><br />
<strong>Ajinkya Rahane | Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>&quot;I thought we were in a strong position until around the 13th over, but then we lost two to three wickets in quick succession, and the momentum completely shifted. It&rsquo;s just the first game of the season, so we&rsquo;ll assess things quickly and move forward.Yes, while I was batting with Venkatesh, we felt 210&ndash;220 was very much on the cards. But credit to RCB &mdash; they bowled exceptionally well in the latter half of our innings.There was a bit of dew, yes, but more than that, I think they batted brilliantly in the powerplay. As I mentioned earlier, a total of 170&ndash;180 on this surface was below par. We were targeting 200-plus, and not getting early breakthroughs with the ball really hurt us tonight.That said, we&rsquo;re not going to dwell too much on this result. It&rsquo;s a long season. We&rsquo;ll regroup, improve as a unit, and come back stronger in the upcoming matches.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | Royal Challengers &nbsp;Bengaluru&nbsp;Captain:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&quot;There was definitely pressure, but it turned out to be a good day for me &mdash; and if we keep playing like this, I hope there are many more to come.The plan was very clear. I wanted the wicket of Andre Russell at any cost. Even if Suyash went for a few runs, I backed him as our strike bowler &mdash; and he delivered. That moment was crucial.Both Krunal and Suyash deserve massive credit. KKR were flying around the 13th over, but the way they pulled things back was simply brilliant. Their composure turned the game in our favour.It&rsquo;s also a great feeling to lead someone like Virat Kohli &mdash; he&rsquo;s incredibly supportive and having that kind of experience in the camp helps a lot. I&rsquo;m learning every day with this group of leaders around me.&nbsp;Yeah, that was actually a premeditated shot &mdash; I was aiming to go over cover, but the ball nipped back a bit, and it ended up flying over backward point instead. Luckily, it worked out!&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Krunal Pandya | Player of the Match:</strong><br />
<span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>&quot;Honestly, nothing much &mdash; I just realised that with so much crowd noise, it&rsquo;s important to narrow your focus. When I came back to bowl my second over, I zoned in and just focused on delivering good balls. I&rsquo;m happy I could step up and contribute for the team.In T20s, if batters want to go big, they&rsquo;ll have to do it against my best deliveries. That&rsquo;s the mindset. These days, batters have so many options and skills &mdash; as a bowler, you&rsquo;ve got to keep evolving with the game. Everyone talks about changes of pace &mdash; usually about pacers &mdash; but for spinners too, variation in speed is a powerful weapon. I&rsquo;ve got a wide yorker and even a bouncer in my toolkit, and Jitesh Sharma is well aware of that. He&rsquo;s always ready, which gives me the confidence to execute those variations when needed. Joining RCB has been incredible. The energy around this franchise is unreal. Even when I played domestic cricket in Bengaluru, I could hear RCB chants from the stands. It&rsquo;s been only ten days with the squad, but it already feels like something special.&quot;</strong></span></p>
